As an infant in Florida in 1980, Holly was barely a year old when her parents, <a href=#>newlyweds Harold Dean Clouse Jr. and Tina Gail Linn</a>, uprooted their small family and headed to Texas for a job opportunity.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The couple settled in Lewisville, a Dallas suburb, but just a few months later, their families stopped hearing from them. The Clouse and Linn families never saw them again.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The trio’s whereabouts remained a mystery until late last year, when genealogists from Identifinders International used DNA and genetic genealogy to identify a pair of bodies found in Harris County woods in January 1981 as the missing couple.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Dean Clouse, called “Junior” by his mother, and Linn had been murdered.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Baby Holly was nowhere to be found.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#><i><b>>> Related story: Houston couple found slain 40 years ago identified, but baby daughter still missing</b></i></a></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Last year’s discovery, <a href=#>which was announced by authorities in January</a>, launched extensive efforts to learn what had happened to Holly.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">On Wednesday, <a href=#>the Texas Attorney General’s Office announced</a> that Holly has been found alive and well in Oklahoma. Mindy Montford, senior counsel for the AG’s office, and Detective Craig Holloman, with the Lewisville Police Department, located her Tuesday at her place of employment.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Holly, now a mother of five and grandmother of two, was found on what would have been Clouse’s 63rd birthday, <a href=#>according to KHOU</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">In a photo, Holly smiles broadly while holding a photo of herself, as an infant, with her slain parents.

We have found Holly.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">No information about Holly’s childhood or the people who raised her has been released. The criminal investigation into the murders of Clouse and Linn, as well as the abduction of their daughter, is ongoing.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Authorities had a news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon to offer more information.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#><i><b>>> Read more trending news</b></i></a></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Her grateful loved ones thanked the Texas Attorney General’s Office’s <a href=#>Cold Case and Missing Persons Unit</a>, as well as other law enforcement agencies in Texas, Florida and Arizona for the work they put in to find Holly.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">They also thanked Misty Gillis, senior forensic genealogist for Identifinders International, and Gillis’ former colleague, genealogist Allison Peacock. Peacock is the founder of Family History Detectives, or FHD Forensics.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Allison is forever our angel in helping us through this whole heartbreaking experience,” <a href=#>Casasanta told KHOU</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Gillis and Peacock <a href=#>told the Houston Chronicle</a> they were amazed to see how much Holly looks like her mother.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“It was extremely surreal, to see her,” <a href=#>Peacock said</a>. “To see what she looks like. To see her mother reflected in her face.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I cried during the whole thing,” <a href=#>Gillis admitted</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Peacock credited Casasanta and the rest of Holly’s family with keeping faith that they would someday find the missing woman.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“They’ve spent the past six months with me digging through records, gathering photos for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s age progression portrait, and documenting memories of Holly and her parents in an effort to help law enforcement,” <a href=#>Peacock said</a>. “What matters is that Holly was found happy and alive and now knows she has a huge extended family that has loved her for decades.”</p><h3 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 duFLhq"><b>Hope for Holly finally realized</b></h3><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Clouse and Linn, who married in June 1979, left their New Smyrna Beach home for Texas so Clouse could pursue carpentry work.

The dog led authorities to a wooded, undeveloped area off Wallisville Road, where they found the decomposing body of a woman who had been strangled.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Nearby was the body of a man.

At that time, forensic anthropologist Dr. Jennifer Love, known as “Dr. Bones” for her work in the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office, <a href=#>was able to give the Chronicle</a> some tidbits of information about the pair.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Both had “beautiful teeth,” <a href=#>Love told the paper</a>.
