Just watching how the sun is reflecting on the waves of the water is so beautiful,” she said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">If you don’t want to get sand all over you, there’s a grassy area for that. <span class=credit>NY Post</span></figure><p>Lauren Seikaly and Michael Gallagher said they originally planned to take their business meeting at 1:30 p.m. but redirected to the newly opened beach spot at noon for a change of scenery. They were seated right by the shore, just between the rocks and the sand, with a view of the New Jersey skyline.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a gorgeous day, I had to dig out all of my summer clothes again because I put them all away two weeks ago when it was 15 degrees out,” Seikaly said.&nbsp;“It’s amazing, we’re very much enjoying the beach.</p><p>“We had a business lunch at 1:30, and he called me and said, ‘OK, the beach opened, so we should meet there at 12,’ and so here we are,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“I cannot get over this sand, I’m pouring it all over my body parts and I’m like … this beach is not going to stay clean for too long.”&nbsp;</p><p>Gallagher, a lawyer, added, “We’re having a business meeting right here — it’s the new office of Manhattan, everybody should be here.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">You can’t get views like this on the Jersey Shore. <span class=credit>NY Post</span></figure><p>“I used to go down to Pier 64, and this is much closer, much better, good scenery — I just hope it doesn’t get washed away,” he said.&nbsp;“This is the perfect place for law, small business and the beach.”</p><p>Taylor Yasui and Francis Wong were sunbathing in their swimsuits on a patch of grass, listening to music on a portable speaker.</p><p>“I saw a post on my city council representative’s Instagram that this beach just opened yesterday, and I was like — tomorrow’s going to be 80 degrees, we have to come here, whatever work I have can wait but this cannot,” Yasui said.&nbsp;</p><p>Wong said, “You have to make the most of the sun when it’s out, especially in New York.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bathing suits and bare chests were on full display Tuesday at the new beach, which was designed by the same firm behind Manhattan’s now-famous High Line park. <span class=credit>Gabriella Bass</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Adirondack chairs provide breathtaking city views. <span class=credit>Hudson River Park</span></figure><p>Swimming in the Hudson River was off limits, and Park Enforcement officers from the Parks Department were on hand to make sure everyone complied. But several kayakers were taking advantage of the beach’s non-motorized boat launch.</p><p>“We were the first people to kayak here, we were at the launch yesterday,” said Bitz Gernboeck who works at the Pier 26 Boathouse, where New Yorkers can access kayaks and paddle them upriver to the beach.</p><p>“It’s a volunteer program, and we put people on the water, you know, the public. … We’re the biggest boathouse and public program for free kayaking,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Monday’s ribbon cutting was attended by a sunglasses-clad Gov. Kathy Hochul — who made a major flub while discussing the history of parks in the boroughs.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The beach features 1,200 tons of sand, blue beach chairs with umbrellas, tables and benches by the water and open green, grassy park spaces. <span class=credit>Gabriella Bass</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Gov.

Since then, the city built four public parks larger than the Manhattan gem: Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park, Flushing Meadows/Corona Park and Staten Island’s Greenbelt.</p><p>The riverside retreat is Manhattan’s first and only public beach, although unsanctioned patches of sandy beach exist by the South Street Seaport.</p><p>The large sandy beaches that covered the dredged landfill that now houses Battery Park City used to attract adventurous beach-going Manhattan residents until construction began in 1981, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wild images</a> published by the New York Times four years ago show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmaWtfobansdJmmGaalZawqXnMmqWhmaSprq95y5qlnatdm7azv9Nmp66anJ6wbr%2FAp5usZZGjsW662J6prGWjpK6secSmZK6oXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flifes-a-beach-manhattan-lands-first-public-sands-and-nyers-soak-em-up.html&text=Life%27s%20a%20beach%21%20Manhattan%20lands%20first%20public%20sands%20--%20and%20NYers%20soak%20%27em%20up&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flifes-a-beach-manhattan-lands-first-public-sands-and-nyers-soak-em-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flifes-a-beach-manhattan-lands-first-public-sands-and-nyers-soak-em-up.html&title=Life%27s%20a%20beach%21%20Manhattan%20lands%20first%20public%20sands%20--%20and%20NYers%20soak%20%27em%20up" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flifes-a-beach-manhattan-lands-first-public-sands-and-nyers-soak-em-up.html&title=Life%27s%20a%20beach%21%20Manhattan%20lands%20first%20public%20sands%20--%20and%20NYers%20soak%20%27em%20up" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flifes-a-beach-manhattan-lands-first-public-sands-and-nyers-soak-em-up.html&title=Life%27s%20a%20beach%21%20Manhattan%20lands%20first%20public%20sands%20--%20and%20NYers%20soak%20%27em%20up" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flifes-a-beach-manhattan-lands-first-public-sands-and-nyers-soak-em-up.html&description=Life%27s%20a%20beach%21%20Manhattan%20lands%20first%20public%20sands%20--%20and%20NYers%20soak%20%27em%20up" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rebecca-kolls-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rebecca Kolls Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jesse-armstrong.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jesse Armstrong">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
