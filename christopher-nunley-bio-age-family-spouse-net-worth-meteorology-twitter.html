Periodic tropical downpours will occur across the Southeast this evening through tomorrow (Monday). The best chance for flash flooding will occur in northern Georgia, upstate South Carolina, eastern Tennessee and western/central North Carolina on Monday</p><p>Late Monday into Tuesday, a cold front will push into the Southeast. Along the cold front, a line of showers and thunderstorms is possible, which could dump brief but heavy rain. Luckily, behind the cold front, drying will take place (see Fig. 2), which will briefly put an end to most shower and thunderstorm activity for a large part of the Southeast (other than coastal areas of the Carolinas/Georgia and Florida where heavy rain may lead to flooding</p><p>The drier air mass behind the cold front will be temporary. On Wednesday, a trough will push into the region (see Fig. 3) allowing a low to develop across northern Florida/southern Georgia. This low will intensify and lift northeast. This will pull Gulf moisture back into the Southeast (see Fig. 4) increasing rain chances for the Southeast Wednesday into Thursday. Some of this rain will be heavy, which will exacerbate the flooding issues in Georgia and the Carolinas on both Wednesday and early Thursday. Additional rain accumulations of 3-6″ are likely through Thursday for Florida, eastern Georgia, central and eastern South Carolina and much of North Carolina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmLWztdKtpqmglad6r8HNpZyyZZKevG6txp5kn5mdnrm6edKppq6rlWK7psCMsKarrJhiuqbAxKipqKSfnMZuwNaiq62domQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchristopher-nunley-bio-age-family-spouse-net-worth-meteorology-twitter.html&text=Christopher%20Nunley%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20meteorology%2c%20Twitter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchristopher-nunley-bio-age-family-spouse-net-worth-meteorology-twitter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchristopher-nunley-bio-age-family-spouse-net-worth-meteorology-twitter.html&title=Christopher%20Nunley%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20meteorology%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchristopher-nunley-bio-age-family-spouse-net-worth-meteorology-twitter.html&title=Christopher%20Nunley%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20meteorology%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchristopher-nunley-bio-age-family-spouse-net-worth-meteorology-twitter.html&title=Christopher%20Nunley%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20meteorology%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchristopher-nunley-bio-age-family-spouse-net-worth-meteorology-twitter.html&description=Christopher%20Nunley%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20meteorology%2c%20Twitter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erik-von-detten-and-wife-angela-welcome-baby-no-2-see-the-first-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erik von Detten and Wife Angela Welcome Baby No. 2">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alex-iafallo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-490147-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Iafallo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
