He was a football superstar, a Hollywood actor, a murder suspect, and a convicted felon. But is he still alive? And what is he doing now? Here is everything you need to know about OJ Simpson’s life and legacy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OJ Simpson’s Football Career</h2><p>OJ Simpson was born on July 9, 1947, in San Francisco, California. He grew up in a poor and violent neighborhood, where he joined a street gang called the Persian Warriors. He was arrested several times for petty crimes, but his athletic talent saved him from a life of crime. He played football at Galileo High School, where he was a star running back. He then attended City College of San Francisco, where he led his team to a national junior college championship. He transferred to the University of Southern California (USC) in 1967, where he became one of the greatest college football players of all time. He won the Heisman Trophy in 1968, the most prestigious award in college football, and was a two-time unanimous All-American. He also helped USC win the national championship in 1967.</p><p>Simpson was drafted first overall by the Buffalo Bills in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft. He played for the Bills for nine seasons, from 1969 to 1977, and then for the San Francisco 49ers for two seasons, from 1978 to 1979. He was one of the most dominant and popular running backs in NFL history. He was a five-time Pro Bowler, a five-time first-team All-Pro, and the NFL MVP in 1973. He also led the league in rushing yards four times, in rushing touchdowns twice, and in points scored in 1975. He was the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, a feat he achieved in 1973, and the only player to do so in a 14-game regular season. He holds the record for the single-season yards-per-game average at 143.1. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OJ Simpson’s Acting and Broadcasting Career</h2><p>After retiring from football, Simpson pursued a career in acting and broadcasting. He appeared in several movies and TV shows, such as The Towering Inferno, The Naked Gun, and Roots. He was also a commentator for Monday Night Football and The NFL on NBC. He was one of the most recognizable and beloved celebrities in America, with a charming and charismatic personality. He also endorsed several products, such as Hertz, Dingo Boots, and Pioneer Chicken. He was a multimillionaire and lived a lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OJ Simpson’s Murder Trial</h2><p>Simpson’s life changed dramatically in 1994, when he was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The murders took place on June 12, 1994, outside Brown’s condo in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Simpson was arrested on June 17, 1994, after a dramatic low-speed chase in his white Ford Bronco, which was broadcast live on national TV. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and hired a team of high-profile lawyers, known as the “Dream Team”, which included Johnnie Cochran, Robert Shapiro, F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, and Robert Kardashian. The trial began on January 24, 1995, and lasted for nine months. It was one of the most notorious and publicized criminal trials in American history, dubbed as the “Trial of the Century”. It was also televised live on several networks, attracting millions of viewers.</p><p>The prosecution, led by Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden, presented a wealth of physical and circumstantial evidence against Simpson, such as DNA, blood, fingerprints, shoe prints, hair, fibers, and a bloody glove found at the crime scene and at Simpson’s estate. They also portrayed Simpson as a jealous and abusive husband, who had a history of domestic violence against Brown. The defense, led by Cochran, challenged the credibility and integrity of the evidence and the investigators, alleging that they were contaminated, planted, or mishandled. They also argued that Simpson was a victim of racial discrimination and police misconduct, especially by Detective Mark Fuhrman, who was accused of being a racist and a perjurer. They also introduced the famous phrase “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit”, referring to Simpson’s inability to wear the bloody glove during a courtroom demonstration.</p><p>The jury, composed of nine African Americans, two whites, and one Hispanic, deliberated for less than four hours and reached a verdict on October 3, 1995. They found Simpson not guilty of both murders, to the shock and dismay of many people, especially the victims’ families. The verdict also sparked a heated debate and a deep division in the country along racial lines, as many African Americans celebrated Simpson’s acquittal, while many whites condemned it. The trial exposed the issues of race, class, gender, and media in the American justice system and society.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OJ Simpson’s Civil Trial and Later Legal Troubles</h2><p>Simpson’s legal troubles did not end with his acquittal. In 1997, he faced a civil trial for the wrongful deaths of Brown and Goldman, brought by their families. The civil trial was different from the criminal trial in several ways, such as the lower burden of proof, the higher number of jurors, the exclusion of cameras, and the admission of new evidence and witnesses. The civil jury, composed of eight whites, two blacks, one Hispanic, and one Asian, deliberated for four days and reached a verdict on February 4, 1997. They found Simpson liable for the deaths and awarded the plaintiffs $33.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Simpson appealed the verdict, but it was upheld by the California Supreme Court in 2001. Simpson has never paid the full amount of the judgment, claiming that he is broke and living off his NFL pension, which is protected from creditors.</p><p>Simpson also faced several other legal issues after his acquittal, such as lawsuits, tax liens, and criminal charges. In 2000, he was accused of assaulting a motorist in a road rage incident, but was acquitted by a jury. In 2001, he was arrested for burglary and battery after breaking into a hotel room in Miami, Florida, to retrieve some memorabilia that he claimed were stolen from him, but the charges were dropped. In 2007, he was involved in a similar incident in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he and five other men armed with guns stormed into a hotel room and took some sports memorabilia from two dealers, who were also his former associates. He was arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including kidnapping, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced to 33 years in prison, with the possibility of parole after nine years. He appealed his conviction, but it was affirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court in 2010.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OJ Simpson’s Parole and Current Status</h2><p>Simpson was granted parole in July 2017, after serving nine years in prison. He was released on October 1, 2017, and moved to Nevada, where he lives in a gated community in Las Vegas. He is on parole until 2022, and has to follow several conditions, such as reporting to his parole officer, submitting to drug tests, and staying away from alcohol and firearms. He is also prohibited from contacting the victims or their families of his Las Vegas robbery case.</p><p>Simpson is now 76 years old and in good health, according to his lawyer and friends. He spends his time playing golf, watching sports, and hanging out with his family and friends. He also maintains a low profile and avoids the media attention, although he occasionally gives interviews or makes public appearances. He also joined Twitter in 2019, where he posts videos and comments on various topics, such as sports, politics, and his personal life. He has over 900,000 followers on the platform.</p><p>Simpson has four surviving children from his two marriages: Arnelle, Jason, Sydney, and Justin. He also had a daughter named Aaren, who died in 1979 from drowning in the family pool. He was married to Marguerite Whitley from 1967 to 1979, and to Nicole Brown from 1985 to 1992. He also had a longtime girlfriend named Christie Prody, who he dated from 1996 to 2009. He is currently single and not looking for a relationship, according to his friends.</p><p>Simpson has always maintained his innocence in the murders of Brown and Goldman, and has repeatedly expressed his desire to find the “real killers”. He has also claimed that he is at peace with himself and with God, and that he has no regrets or bitterness in his life. He has also said that he wants to live a quiet and simple life, and to enjoy his freedom and his family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is OJ Simpson Dead?</h2><p>The answer to the question “Is OJ Simpson dead?” is no. He is alive and well, living in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is a free man, but not a free spirit. He is a legend, but not a hero. He is a paradox, but not a mystery. He is OJ Simpson, and he is still here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuu8lmqqKloKi8r3nDnpidZaSdsm7A0a6roWWRl7y2wIytn55lnpu5brjEoJynnKNiuaqyxGaYp5xdobKorcKyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-oj-simpson-dead-the-truth-about-the-nfl-legends-life-and-legacy.html&text=Is%20OJ%20Simpson%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20NFL%20Legends%20Life%20and%20Legacy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-oj-simpson-dead-the-truth-about-the-nfl-legends-life-and-legacy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-oj-simpson-dead-the-truth-about-the-nfl-legends-life-and-legacy.html&title=Is%20OJ%20Simpson%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20NFL%20Legends%20Life%20and%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-oj-simpson-dead-the-truth-about-the-nfl-legends-life-and-legacy.html&title=Is%20OJ%20Simpson%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20NFL%20Legends%20Life%20and%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-oj-simpson-dead-the-truth-about-the-nfl-legends-life-and-legacy.html&title=Is%20OJ%20Simpson%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20NFL%20Legends%20Life%20and%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-oj-simpson-dead-the-truth-about-the-nfl-legends-life-and-legacy.html&description=Is%20OJ%20Simpson%20Dead%3f%20The%20Truth%20About%20the%20NFL%20Legends%20Life%20and%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-comparison-between-the-law-order-true-crime-the-menendez-murders-stars-and-the-real-life-players-will-give-you-chills.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Menendez Murders Cast Look Creepily Similar">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gillian-flynn-husband-who-is-brett-nolan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gillian Flynn Husband: Who Is Brett Nolan?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
