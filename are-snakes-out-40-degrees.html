At cold temperatures, these reactions are slow and at warm temperatures they are fast. These chemical reactions are optimal at body temperatures are between 70 - 90 degrees Farenheit. Below 60 degrees Farenheit, snakes become sluggish. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What temperature do snakes like the most?</h2>The most important thing to remember is that reptiles are cold-blooded animals. This is why humid and warm conditions are essential for most species. Reptile species vary, but most require a constant temperature between 70 to 85°F with basking areas that reach over 100°F. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on sensorpush.com</a><h2>A Snake In 40 Degree Weather?!?!?</h2><h2>Is 50 degrees too cold for snakes?</h2>Rattlesnakes can move at any temperature above freezing, but it is rare to see them out and about at temperatures below 65 F. And it's very rare for them to be “active” below 55 F.
