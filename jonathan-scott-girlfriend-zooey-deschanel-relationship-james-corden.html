Instead, Deschanel has opted to date men like Jason Schwartzman in the past.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Zooey Deschanel Has Been Up To Since 'New Girl'</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Zooey Deschanel, she has struggled to find the right partner in the past, which is something most people go through. In fact, Deschanel has been divorced twice and she shares two kids with one of her exes which makes it great that <a href=#>the former spouses get along</a>.</p><p>To the surprise of most observers, Zooey Deschanel has been dating Jonathan Scott for several years now. Given that in the past <a href=#>Scott had never dated anyone as famous as Deschanel</a>, that begs an obvious question, how did the couple get together?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-james-corden-bring-zooey-deschanel-and-jonathan-scott-together>How Did James Corden Bring Zooey Deschanel And Jonathan Scott Together?</h2><p>After serving as arguably one of the best talk show hosts of all time, Craig Ferguson disappointed his fans when he announced that he was stepping away from his late-night show. After Ferguson's final show, James Corden was tapped to replace him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zooey Deschanel And Her 'Property Brother' Boyfriend Have A Strange Nickname For His Twin</a></span></p><p>In the years since The Late Late Show with James Corden premiered, <a href=#>the show's host has unfortunately garnered a lot of hate</a>. Despite that, there is no denying that Corden's late-night talk show has enjoyed a lot of success.</p><p>At the height of The Late Late Show with James Corden's popularity, the Carpool Karaoke segment became a sensation. In fact, the segment was so beloved that it got its own spin-off show, Carpool Karaoke: The Series.</p><p>Back when Carpool Karaoke was just a recurring segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden, major musicians were a staple. Once Carpool Karaoke: The Series premiered, however, the show's producers needed to widen the net.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the musical parameters being loosened, the Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott starred in an episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series. During the same episode, Emily and Zooey Deschanel appeared.</p><p>As it turns out, Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">met during the filming of that Carpool Karaoke: The Series episode</a>. After hitting it off, the pair began dating and the rest is history.</p><p>Even though James Corden doesn't appear onscreen during most Carpool Karaoke: The Series episodes, he plays a huge role in the show. After all, Corden is credited as a Carpool Karaoke: The Series' co-creator and executive producer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this point, there is no way to know if James Corden has any ongoing role in which celebrities appear on Carpool Karaoke: The Series. However, Carpool Karaoke: The Series never would have existed in the first place if it wasn't for Corden.</p><p>Whether or not James Corden approved Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott appearing in the same episode, the couple met due to Carpool Karaoke: The Series. Since that show never would have existed if it wasn't for Corden, he played a major role in them becoming a couple.</p><h2 id=how-serious-is-zooey-deschanel-and-jonathan-scott-39-s-relationship>How Serious Is Zooey Deschanel And Jonathan Scott's Relationship?</h2><p>Unfortunately, most of the time when people meet and hit it off, they wind up going their separate ways before too long. But Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott have been together ever since 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Zooey Deschanel And Jonathan Scott's Relationship</a></span></p><p>On top of continuing to date for several years as of this point, the couple has been very happy together based on everything that is known about Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott's relationship.</p><p>As early as a few months after they met, Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott already were making matching Christmas decorations together. Since then, it has only seemed like the couple is getting closer together.</p><p>A perfect example of how tight Zooey Deschanel and Jonathan Scott became relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus spread across the world, Scott posted an image that seemingly implied he was quarantining with Deschanel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that Jonathan Scott and Zooey Deschanel's relationship survived that kind of pressure cooker says a lot about their connection. As it turns out, that was far from the only indication that Scott and Deschanel were very serious about each other.</p><p>In December 2021, Jonathan Scott revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he bought a home with Zooey Deschanel</a> in May of 2020. Scott also spoke about Deschanel's children seeing the home for the first time which seemingly indicated he has a relationship with them.</p><p>In late 2020, Jonathan Scott publically denied that he and Zooey Deschanel had gotten engaged. While there is no indication that the couple is eager to walk down the aisle, it is clear that they have built a life and future together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRqbWiuoysmqispGK0qr7Ln6minZ6Zeru7zp6wZpyVqLCprc2eo2aqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBit6K5xKxknKeimbKvew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjonathan-scott-girlfriend-zooey-deschanel-relationship-james-corden.html&text=James%20Corden%20Is%20Responsible%20For%20Jonathan%20Scott%20And%20Zooey%20Deschanel%27s%20Relationship%2c%20Here%27s%20How&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjonathan-scott-girlfriend-zooey-deschanel-relationship-james-corden.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjonathan-scott-girlfriend-zooey-deschanel-relationship-james-corden.html&title=James%20Corden%20Is%20Responsible%20For%20Jonathan%20Scott%20And%20Zooey%20Deschanel%27s%20Relationship%2c%20Here%27s%20How" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjonathan-scott-girlfriend-zooey-deschanel-relationship-james-corden.html&title=James%20Corden%20Is%20Responsible%20For%20Jonathan%20Scott%20And%20Zooey%20Deschanel%27s%20Relationship%2c%20Here%27s%20How" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjonathan-scott-girlfriend-zooey-deschanel-relationship-james-corden.html&title=James%20Corden%20Is%20Responsible%20For%20Jonathan%20Scott%20And%20Zooey%20Deschanel%27s%20Relationship%2c%20Here%27s%20How" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjonathan-scott-girlfriend-zooey-deschanel-relationship-james-corden.html&description=James%20Corden%20Is%20Responsible%20For%20Jonathan%20Scott%20And%20Zooey%20Deschanel%27s%20Relationship%2c%20Here%27s%20How" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-baxter-to-replace-slabtown-public-house-and-more-restaurant-news-from-the-week.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Baxter to replace Slabtown Public House and more restaurant news from the week">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./drake-mocks-joe-budden-over-for-all-the-dogs-commentary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drake Mocks Joe Budden Over 'For All the Dogs' Commentary">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
