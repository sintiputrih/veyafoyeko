The sisters <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>grew up in Gainesville, Florida</a>, and began modeling together when they signed with the Ford Agency at 11 years old. They also began acting and were featured in Doublemint Gum commercials as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Doublemint Twins</a>. At 19, they moved to Los Angeles to begin filming season 2 of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Sweet Valley High</a>. Brittany continued working as an actress while Cynthia got behind the camera and became a photographer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, the sisters have started <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a shared Instagram</a> page and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a lifestyle blog</a> called The Sweet Life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, the Daniel sisters spoke with PEOPLE about the closeness of their relationship. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>We are so intertwined</a>," Brittany said. "Everything that's hers is mine and everything that's mine is hers."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Brittany was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011 and learned she might never be able to have children of her own, Cynthia donated her eggs to her sister. On Oct. 24, 2021, Brittany and her husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Adam Touni</a> welcomed their daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Hope Rose Touni</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I saw it as such a simple gift I could give to her," Cynthia told PEOPLE.

The twins also appeared in 1995's The Basketball Diaries with costar <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. Cynthia stepped away from acting after Sweet Valley High <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ended in 1997</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While she's since devoted herself to photography, Cynthia returned to the screen nearly 25 years later. In 2022, she and Brittany starred in the Disney+ remake of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cheaper by the Dozen</a>. They announced their involvement in 2021 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>on Instagram</a>. "Back together again!" they wrote.

She and Hauser welcomed a second son, Colt Daniel, on June 12, 2008. The pair welcomed their daughter, Steely Rose, in 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, Cynthia <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted on Instagram</a> to honor her husband on Father's Day.

The actor shared that, although he loves Montana, it's rough being away from his children and his wife for months at a time while shooting Yellowstone. "We've been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>together for 25 years</a>," he said of Cynthia, noting that while he's away, his sons "kind of take over, making sure that mom and Steely are watched over. That's how I raised them and I'm proud of them for that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the future, Hauser shared that he's looking forward to relaxing on a "little island somewhere" with Cynthia. "We're just going to have our feet up, boat kind of out in the ocean, nothing too crazy. Just enjoying the second half of our life," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Cynthia's Instagram, it looks like the pair may be reaching that goal sooner rather than later. In June 2022, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted a shot</a> of her twirling in a dress in front of crystal-clear water. "This picture truly captures how happy I am to be living in my home state again," she wrote. "I never thought in my wildest dreams I would move back to Florida.

The blog features everything from recipes to fashion and beauty advice to photography tips from the pro herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like our fans helped create this," Cynthia told PEOPLE after the site's launch.

"So I feel super grateful to be here with my sister who was a big part of my recovery and the reason why I'm here."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Cynthia was asked what it was like watching her sister go through her cancer journey, she said: "It is horribly painful to see your sister going through that and you almost want to take their place, you're like, 'Can I just switch positions for a day so she can have a break and just have a normal life again?' It was definitely challenging, of course."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At another Stand Up To Cancer event in 2016, Brittany revealed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Morning Show with Aaron Michael Sanchez</a> that their dad had passed away from lung cancer. Cynthia added that, while her sister's diagnosis and battle was extremely challenging, they both grew from the experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's definitely made me braver and stronger," Cynthia said. "Just watching her go through this and seeing her strength, makes me feel like I can do anything and I feel like this happened to her for others to look up to her and I know she'll be such a great spokeswoman."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-is-her-husbands-rock></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She is her husband's "rock"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jason Kempin/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Yellowstone star often posts shots of his wife on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted a photo</a> of Cynthia looking out at the mountains of Montana. "My rock and mountains together," he wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Being away for months at a time is a struggle, Hauser has said, but the couple make sure Cynthia is able to visit him in his home away from home. The two also make a point to have getaways from time to time. In a July 2022 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram post</a>, Hauser shared that Cynthia went the extra mile on a trip to attend the Calgary Stampede. "After a long week of being on my feet working, my amazing wife woke me to rub my feet," he wrote.
