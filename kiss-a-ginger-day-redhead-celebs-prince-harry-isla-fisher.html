Who? Prince Harry</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/11b8a242-daf1-46f2-b057-ff9dafd9c747.jpg><p>Coming out on top, Prince Harry, 36, is the ginger icon people would most like to kiss - although wife Meghan may have something to say about that.</p><p>A whopping 83 percent&nbsp;of respondents voted the prince as the most attractive redhead, a trait he's said to have inherited from his grandfather, Prince Philip.</p><p>The prince regularly jokes about his hair colour, and even teamed up with fellow redhead Ed Sheeran to produce a hilarious spoof video for World Mental Health Day, which showed Ed mistakenly believing they're meeting to 'raise awareness' about the difficulties ginger people face.</p><h2>Bullied to beauty</h2><h4>2. Who? Actress Isla Fisher</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/17030838-1eb8-436e-8f27-5c99ff691d37.jpg><p>In second place is&nbsp;Wedding Crashers' Isla Fisher, with 81 per cent of respondents voting for her as one of the most attractive redheads.</p><p>But while her beauty is undeniable, the 44-year-old actress admits she didn't always love her luscious locks.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Men's Journal, </a>she revealed: "I got teased growing up in Australia and then in London, where people label you a ginger. It can make you feel like an outsider.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000564777431.jpg><p>"I was the only redhead in my class, with people calling me carrot top or asking whether the carpet matches the drapes.</p><p>"Now I embrace it because it makes me unique."</p><h2>Jessica Rabbit who?</h2><h4>3. Who? Golden Globe winner Jessica Chastain</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000367458218.jpg><p>American actress Jessica Chastain, 43, is proud to be a redhead - and now only dyes her hair if it's essential for a film role.</p><p>The Golden-Globe winning star told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Refinery29</a>: "Whatever you are ridiculed about that makes you different is what you'll celebrate in the future.</p><p>"If I wanted to dye my hair, I could, but I realised that's who I am, and my differences (make me) special."</p><h2>Stunning Scottish roots</h2><h4>4. Who? Doctor Who star Karen Gillan</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2d6f5689-679b-49b5-9a2e-2dd5b6445508.jpg><p>Born in Inverness, Scotland, flame-haired Karen can attribute her gorgeous barnet to her Celtic roots.</p><p>Discussing her unique looks, the 33-year-old star said she now "loves" her red hair and porcelain skin.</p><p>The Avengers actress has also admitted when she has kids, she hopes they inherit her hair colour - and her love of horror movies.</p><p>When asked if she wanted to have children in a podcast interview, she said: “Of course, I need some little ginger children running around."</p><h2>'Gingers have more fun'</h2><h4>5. Who? Irish actor Michael Fassbender</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/720d97f5-e1ff-4e8c-9038-5330683fbbf0.jpg><p>Not only does Irish star Michael Fassbender boast a fabulous, fiery head of hair, he also has a copper beard to match.</p><p>Around 74 per cent of people taking part in the survey found the 43-year-old actor attractive, landing him in fifth place.</p><p>However despite the accolade and his pride regarding his natural hair colour, Michael often dyes it for film roles.</p><p>Speaking to Pop Sugar, he jokingly said: "I'm a ginger. There's not much more fun you can get [than] as a ginger - that's why there's so much resentment to the ginger community."</p><h2>A subtle shade</h2><h4>6. Who? Actor Ewan McGregor</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000612756004.jpg><p>You'd be forgiven for being a little surprised to see Scottish actor Ewan McGregor in the top ten, because he frequently dyes his hair darker for roles.</p><p>However, the Moulin Rouge actor, 49, is naturally a redhead, and while his hue may be subtle in comparison to more 'loud and proud' ginger stars, he has still earned himself a spot in the top ten.</p><h2>Desperate to be a Weasley</h2><h4>7. Who? Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000173660696.jpg><p>Eddie Redmayne's chiselled cheek bones and strawberry blonde hair have won the Theory Of Everything actor a whole host of admirers.</p><p>However, there is one thing his hair didn't win him that he's a tad bitter about - a role as a member of the all-ginger Weasley family, in Harry Potter.</p><p>Speaking to ITV's Lorraine, the 39-year-old Oscar winner said: "For years I was always like, in the Harry Potter films, there was a whole ginger family, and I never got an audition. And I was like, come on, it's outrageous!</p><p>"Every actor in England was in the Harry Potter films, but I never got the call."</p><h2>'If I dyed my hair my mum would disown me'</h2><h4>8. Riverdale redhead Madelaine Petsch</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000629984041.jpg><p>Riverdale actress Madelaine, 26, has beautiful hair that attracts so much attention, fans even question if it's natural.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flare</a>, Madelaine was quick to clear this up, saying: "My hair is very much real."</p><p>"If I dyed my hair, my mother would actually disown me," she added.</p><h2>Mane attraction</h2><h4>9. Who? Model Lily Cole</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/c8803922-6fe9-453a-b57c-d4ec56a648d0.jpg><p>Her unique beauty and striking appearance&nbsp;have made Lily Cole, 33, one of the most successful British supermodels of recent times - but bizarrely even models aren't immune to being picked on for their looks.</p><p>Speaking about her past experiences, Lily said in an interview: “What are the reasons that kids are bullied? It's because they're different.</p><p>“On a surface level it was mostly because I had red hair. And at that time in England – and I still think it exists as a problem – being ginger was a common kind of slur."</p><h2>'A ginger icon'</h2><h4>10. Who? Julianne Moore</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3c187006-fc5b-49b1-bcac-d7cad734c435.jpg><p>She was dubbed a 'ginger icon' by Late Show host Stephen Colbert, who said: "When you think redhead, you think of Julianne Moore: a beautiful, talented redhead," so it's little surprise Julianne Moore makes the top ten.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>But she has a love - hate relationship with her red locks. Speaking about her hair, the 60-year-old actress said: "I have complicated feelings about it, about being a redhead in general.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I think because people have expectations that your hair has something to do with your personality that you're feisty or you're sexy."</p><p>Whether you were lucky enough to kiss a redhead today or not, there's no denying the 'red hot' hair colour deserves to be celebrated.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Geri Horner dyes her hair ginger in time for Spice Girls reunion tour</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqYWeBdIWPaKKiq6Nirm6zyKeenqpdma66edGem6GdkZl6pLHLnpmsZaCntq%2BvxGafmqqirnqqv8uaZJ%2Bho52ys3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkiss-a-ginger-day-redhead-celebs-prince-harry-isla-fisher.html&text=Happy%20Kiss%20A%20Ginger%20Day%21%20From%20Prince%20Harry%20to%20Isla%20Fisher%2c%20we%20reveal%20the%20top%2010%20red-headed%20celebs%20Br&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkiss-a-ginger-day-redhead-celebs-prince-harry-isla-fisher.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkiss-a-ginger-day-redhead-celebs-prince-harry-isla-fisher.html&title=Happy%20Kiss%20A%20Ginger%20Day%21%20From%20Prince%20Harry%20to%20Isla%20Fisher%2c%20we%20reveal%20the%20top%2010%20red-headed%20celebs%20Br" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkiss-a-ginger-day-redhead-celebs-prince-harry-isla-fisher.html&title=Happy%20Kiss%20A%20Ginger%20Day%21%20From%20Prince%20Harry%20to%20Isla%20Fisher%2c%20we%20reveal%20the%20top%2010%20red-headed%20celebs%20Br" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkiss-a-ginger-day-redhead-celebs-prince-harry-isla-fisher.html&title=Happy%20Kiss%20A%20Ginger%20Day%21%20From%20Prince%20Harry%20to%20Isla%20Fisher%2c%20we%20reveal%20the%20top%2010%20red-headed%20celebs%20Br" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkiss-a-ginger-day-redhead-celebs-prince-harry-isla-fisher.html&description=Happy%20Kiss%20A%20Ginger%20Day%21%20From%20Prince%20Harry%20to%20Isla%20Fisher%2c%20we%20reveal%20the%20top%2010%20red-headed%20celebs%20Br" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./marcelo-claure-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-482237-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marcelo Claure Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./clifford-chattman-gameday-sweatshirt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clifford Chattman &amp;quot;Gameday&amp;quot; Sweatshirt | Fan Arch">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
