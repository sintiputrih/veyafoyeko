In a chapel in Nashville on August 27, the pair exchanged vows in a formal ceremony that was witnessed by their parents and siblings.</span></h3><p>140 guests, including family members and friends, attended the second wedding ceremony, which was conducted at the Paradisus Playa del Carmen resort in Del Carmen, Mexico.</p><p>The couple admitted in an interview that they didn’t get to spend much time together because their families lived so far apart. They responded as follows when questioned about the first wedding:</p><p>We believed a Nashville ceremony with our families would be the perfect occasion for our families to get together because we had to be legally married in the United States before traveling to Mexico.</p><p>The wedded couple said that Hoover’s niece and nephew, as well as Eden’s niece, became great friends with the other family members.</p><p>“Our entire family, including Hilary’s niece and nephew, grew to love Brooke’s niece” (our flower girl and ring bearer). Family and friends have shown us so much love and support that we wanted to celebrate with everyone.</p><p>The outfit Brooke Eden chose was the same one Savin London had her pose in for the Love Inc. magazine cover. Consider the Wldflwrs, a Nashville-based ring provider who played a playlist of the best 1990s music throughout the wedding.</p><p>They provided the rings. A mother-daughter and father-daughter dance and a speech by Colbee, Eden’s niece, were next performed. The song Livin’ La Vida Loca, written and produced by Eden and Ricky Martin, was played as the pair danced.</p><h2><span id=Every_detail_about_Brooke_Eden_is_known>Every detail about Brooke Eden is known</span></h2><p>For the seventh and tenth seasons of American Idol, Brooke Eden gave auditions. She gained popularity after the publication of her song “American Dreamin,” and in 2015, she joined Red Bow Records.</p><p>Eden’s early exposure to her father’s drumming in a neighborhood country band sparked her early musical interest. At nearby music festivals, she once served as the opening act for acts like Alan Jackson and Brooks & Dunn. She obtained her diploma from Wellington High School in 2007, and the following year she won the title of Miss South Florida in a local beauty competition.</p><p>Following her audition, Brooke was selected for the seventh season of American Idol. She advanced to Hollywood week before being booted before the live rounds.</p><p>She tried out once more for the show’s ninth season but was unsuccessful. The 33-year-old released a self-titled EP in 2014. The same year, her song, American Dream, received rave reviews.</p><p>She released the song Daddy’s Money in 2015, and it reached its highest position on the Billboard Country Airplay chart at number 50. After that, Eden released another EP called Welcome to the Weekend. Through the success of songs like Act Like You Don’t, No Shade, Sunroof, and others, she continued to have a successful career.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_between_Brooke_Eden_and_Hilary_Hoover>Relationship between Brooke Eden and Hilary Hoover</span></h2><p>Hillary Hoover and Brooke Eden started dating in 2015. Hoover was working for Eden’s record label at the time. The pair got married in May of 2021, and Eden was born in January. The couple announced that they had moved in together three months into their relationship.</p><p>They also possess three properties and a pet. Eden and Hoover said that after going public with their relationship, they knew they wanted to make it official and that they had known “this was it” from the beginning. They claimed to be genuine partners and said,</p><p>We support one another and work to keep in mind that we are all on the same team. We always give each other a good night kiss, even when we disagree. We put a lot of effort into getting together, and we’re happier than ever. We know we can overcome anything together because of what we’ve been through.</p><p>The couple is ecstatic that the law has recognized their marriage because they feel as though they have been together for a very long time. They intend to spend their honeymoon in Spain and Italy.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Singer-Songwriter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Elvis Perkins- Net Worth, Bio, Girlfriend, Height, Career</a></h3>American folk-rock singer-songwriter Elvis Perkins hails from the country.
