After he died in 2020, both Ken Jennings and Chaya filled in as temporary hosts. Both were eventually selected to become the show’s official hosts.</p><p>However, some viewers may have noticed that she has been absent from the show for some time. While she was supposed to take over from Jennings in January 2023, she has other commitments, including her primetime show, Call Me Kat. As a result, the actress was expected to take over as host on Feb. 20, when the high school reunion tournament begins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mayim-Bialik-12.jpg><p>Despite the delay, Jeopardy! producer Sarah Whitcomb Foss has stated that they are thrilled to have the actress back, even if it’s a little later than they had hoped. Foss also pointed out that she is a very busy woman, which explains the delay in her return to the show.</p><p>The latest pre-recorded episodes hosted by Jennings concluded in April, and the author has taken over as the host since then. Jennings will now be seen hosting the “Jeopardy! Masters tournament” starting on May 8th.</p><h2>Mayim Bialik Age Revealed</h2><p>Mayim is an American actress, neuroscientist, author, and educator born on December 12, 1975, in San Diego, California.
