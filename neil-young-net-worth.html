I’m not worried about the youth. Young people aren’t just looking back. They are also looking forward.”&nbsp;<strong>– Neil Young</strong></p><p>“For whatever you’re doing, for your creative juices, your geography’s got a hell of a lot to do with it.

Today there’s a lot of images that go with the music. A lot of music is crap, and it’s all commercial, and the images are all trying to sell the record.”&nbsp;<strong>– Neil Young</strong></p><p>“All these people talking about morality should take a walk downtown.
