She served as the Senior Counselor to the President in the Donald Trump administration from 2017 to 2020, after having been appointed as Trump’s campaign manager in August 2016.</p><p>Conway was the first woman to run a successful U.S. presidential campaign. Before her role in the Trump administration, Conway held several positions as a campaign manager and strategist in the Republican Party. She was also the former president and CEO of the Polling Company/WomanTrend.</p><p>Conway had a history with Donald Trump, having lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008, and having conducted private polls for Trump in late 2013 when he was considering running for governor of New York.&nbsp;During her time in the Trump administration, Conway was involved in several controversies, including using the phrase “alternative facts” to describe fictitious and disproven attendance numbers for Trump’s inauguration.</p><p>She also spoke multiple times of a “Bowling Green massacre” that never occurred, and claimed that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. In June 2019, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel recommended that Conway be fired for multiple violations of the Hatch Act of 1939. There was also controversy when she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, prompting calls for an ethics investigation.</p><p>She also repeatedly mentioned a hypothetical “Bowling Green massacre” and asserted that Michael Flynn had the President’s complete support before being fired. Conway was recommended to be fired by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel in June 2019 due to numerous violations of the Hatch Act of 1939. Her public endorsement of brands connected to the President’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, sparked controversy and calls for an ethics inquiry.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Super Bowl fun with my FabFour<a href=# rel=noopener>#Eagles</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#GoBirds</a><br>💚💚💚💚 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bGdYNpn280</a></p><p>— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) <a href=# rel=noopener>February 13, 2023</a></p><h2 id=who_is_kellyanne_conway_dating class=smooth-goto>Who is Kellyanne Conway dating?</h2><p>George Conway, a barrister and vocal opponent of former president Donald Trump, and Kellyanne Conway are married, but it is well known that they are divorcing. Together, they are parents to four kids. Due to Kellyanne’s position in the Trump government, as detailed in her book “Unhinged,” the couple’s marriage has reportedly become strained. There are no specifics regarding Kellyanne Conway’s relationships.</p><h2 id=george_conway class=smooth-goto>Who is George Conway?</h2><p>Lawyer and campaigner George Thomas Conway III were born in the United States on September 2, 1963. Conway was once a candidate for Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division at the U.S. Department of Justice and Solicitor General of the United States, but he withdrew his name from consideration.</p><p>Conway became an outspoken Trump critic in 2018, despite his wife Kellyanne serving for the President from 2016 to 2020. He was associated with the Lincoln Project, a group of ex-Republicans working to unseat Trump during the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>Conway effectively argued Morrison v. National Australia Bank, a 2010 case, before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was raised outside of Boston, where his mother was an organic chemist from the Philippines, and his father worked for the military contractor Raytheon. After graduating from Marlborough High School in Marlborough, Massachusetts, Conway attended Harvard College, where William A. Haseltine mentored him.</p><p>He received a Bachelor of Arts in biochemistry, magna cum laude, in 1984. Three years later, he graduated from Yale Law School, where he also served as editor of the Yale Law Journal and President of the campus branch of the Federalist Society.</p><h2 id=kellyanne_conway_relationship_with_george_conway class=smooth-goto>Kellyanne Conway’s Relationship with George Conway</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kellyanne-Conways-Relationship-with-George-Conway-.jpg><p>Former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway and her husband, George Conway, have announced that their amicable divorce is nearing its conclusion in a statement. The pair has four kids together and has been married for over 20 years. In a joint statement, they expressed appreciation for the help they’ve gotten from their loved ones, neighbors, and coworkers. They also agreed to keep cooperating to continue loving, comforting, and safeguarding their kids.</p><p>A lawyer named George Conway was once a candidate for several jobs in the Justice Department of the Trump administration. He urged Kellyanne to run Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016. However, George openly criticized the Trump administration while Kellyanne worked for it, which strained their marriage. George subsequently became one of Trump’s harshest detractors after joining the anti-Trump Republican group the Lincoln Project.</p><p>In a 2022 interview with CNN, Kellyanne said she and George decided to relocate their family to Washington so Kellyanne could work for the Trump administration. Still, George subsequently had second thoughts about Trump. She felt that he had betrayed his promises to her, and this caused their union to suffer. George criticized Trump, to which Trump responded by calling him a “whack job,” a “stone cold LOSER,” and a “husband from hell” who was jealous of his wife’s success. George and Kellyanne revealed in 2020 that they were leaving their jobs at the Lincoln Project and the White House to devote more time to their family.</p><p>The couple’s marriage has received much attention overall due to their divergent views on the Trump government. Despite their difficulties, they reaffirmed their dedication to co-parenting their kids.</p><h2>Kellyanne Conway’s Past Relationships</h2><p>Kellyanne Conway&nbsp;was previously married to&nbsp;George Conway&nbsp;(2001 – 2023).</p><p>Kellyanne Conway has been in a relationship with Fred Thompson in the past.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a class=p-url title="Who is Renee Rapp Boyfriend: Who is the Talented Broadway Star Dating?" href=# rel=bookmark>Who is ReRapp’sRapp Boyfriend: Who is the Talented Broadway Star Dating?</a></li><li><a class=p-url title="Vanessa Bryant Sparks Dating Rumors: Who is Kobe Bryant’s Widow Linked With?" href=# rel=bookmark>Vanessa Bryant Sparks Dating Rumors: Who is Kobe Bryant’s Widow Linked With?</a></li><li><a class=p-url title="Who Is Lexi Rivera Dating: Is She In Relationship With Andrew Davila?" href=# rel=bookmark>Who Is Lexi Rivera Dating: Is Shea&nbsp; In a Relationship With Andrew Davila?</a></li><li><a class=p-url title="Who Is Meg Donnelly Dating?
