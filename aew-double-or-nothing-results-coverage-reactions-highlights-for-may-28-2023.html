Backstage, RJ City provided updates and enthusiastically emphasized that every AEW championship would be up for grabs throughout the pay-per-view event.</p><p>The hosts meticulously discussed the lineup of the show, followed by an engaging video package showcasing the intense Anarchy in the Arena match.</p><p>To provide additional context and build anticipation, a segment featured a clip from Jim Ross’s sit-down interview with Don Callis. In the interview, Callis expressed that he had undertaken the most challenging task any parent or family member could face. He stated firmly that he had taken decisive action to eliminate the destructive element, referring to it as “cutting out the cancer.” Callis directed a piercing gaze into the camera and boldly declared, “Kenny, I haven’t even started cutting.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In the backstage area, RJ City engaged in an interview with Arn Anderson, delving into the upcoming events. City pointed out that it appeared Wardlow was inadvertently playing into Christian Cage’s strategy by accepting a ladder match. Anderson countered by asserting that no one had been coerced into the match, emphasizing the abilities of Wardlow. When City inquired about Anderson having a weapon at ringside, Anderson wittily replied, “Ask your momma.”</p><p>A compelling video package showcased the AEW Women’s Championship match, prompting the panel to share their insights. Paul Wight cleverly quipped that he had experienced more turns than NASCAR.</p><p>Following that, a video package provided insights into the intense feud between Adam Cole and Chris Jericho, highlighting the addition of Sabu to Cole’s corner. Additionally, a brief video on the AEW Tag Team Title match was aired, leading the panel to offer their thoughts and predictions on the upcoming bout.</p><p>The arena resonated with the sound of the Oklahoma fight song as Jim Ross made his entrance, joining Excalibur and Taz at the ringside desk, which was a fresh addition to the setup. Excalibur took the opportunity to mention the company’s fantasy sports partner, setting the stage for an advertisement that was subsequently aired.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Taz expressed his enthusiasm for being ringside, relishing the opportunity it presented. Jim Ross, sharing his thoughts, proclaimed that the show held an aura of mystery and anticipated it to be one of the most physically intense productions in the company’s history. With confidence, Ross gazed into the camera and assured the viewers that they would absolutely love it.</p><p>The entrances for the pre-show match commenced as ring announcer Justin Roberts introduced Ethan Page, Colten Gunn, and Austin Gunn. Hook, making his way to the ramp, stood poised for action while awaiting the arrival of Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, and Isiah “Brother Zay” Kassidy. Notably, Kassidy appeared wearing a bedazzled neck brace, adding a touch of flamboyance to his look.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, and Hook vs. Ethan Page, Colten Gunn, and Austin Gunn</h2><p>The commentary team emphasized the stipulation that if Matt Hardy’s team emerged victorious, he would gain control of Ethan Page’s contract, heightening the stakes of the match. Around the 6-minute mark, Matt executed a second rope elbow drop on Colten Gunn, resulting in a near fall with a two count.</p><p>A confrontation ensued at ringside as Page and Austin Gunn confronted Isiah “Brother Zay” Kassidy. Austin forcefully removed Kassidy’s bedazzled neck brace, causing Kassidy to sell neck pain by collapsing to the ringside mat and remaining down. Excalibur then announced that the opening ceremonies of the Owen Hart Cup tournament would follow the conclusion of this match.</p><p>As the match progressed, Matt found himself isolated by the opposing team, but he managed to fight back and clear them to ringside. Matt came close to making the tag, but Page and Austin intervened by pulling Jeff and Hook off the apron. Eventually, Jeff was able to tag in and unleashed his offense on both Colten and Austin, securing a two count on Austin with a middle rope splash. However, during the setup for another move from the ropes, Jeff slipped and crashed to the mat.</p><p>Soon after, Hook tagged in and took control against Page. Hook executed a suplex on Page and followed it up with a powerful club to the jaw, but Page countered by throwing him to the mat and delivering a solid kick. Colten then tagged in, and Matt made a blind tag. The Hardys executed a double team move on Colten, with Jeff preparing to ascend the ropes but getting cut off. The Gunns managed to hit their double team finisher on Matt, but Jeff broke up their double pin attempt by performing a Swanton onto both of them.</p><p>In the closing moments, the Hardys executed Twist of Fates on the Gunns, leaving Page alone in the ring with all three babyfaces. The Hardys then delivered cutters on Page, and Hook applied the Redrum submission hold, forcing Page to submit and securing the victory for their team.</p><p>Thus, Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, and Hook emerged triumphant over Ethan Page, Colten Gunn, and Austin Gunn in the pre-show match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The broadcast team took a moment to reiterate the lineup for the pay-per-view event, ensuring that the viewers were aware of the exciting matches to come. Specifically, Excalibur announced that the highly anticipated Adam Cole vs. Chris Jericho unsanctioned match would kick off the main card, setting the stage for a thrilling start to the evening.</p><p>Paquette took her position on the stage, which featured a table adorned with men’s and women’s title belts, as well as cup trophies. She introduced Martha Hart, who expressed her happiness at working with AEW and Tony Khan once again. Martha spoke about the excitement surrounding the tournament and mentioned her own attire for the occasion. Just then, Tony Khan made his entrance, donning a fedora that prominently displayed the tournament logo, adding to the festive atmosphere.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The scene shifted to the entrances for the Blackjack Battle Royal. Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta made their way to the ring first, followed by Bandido. Mark Sterling, accompanying “The Varsity Athletes” Ari Daivari, Tony Nese, and Josh Woods, introduced them as they prepared to enter the battle royal.</p><p>The participants of the Blackjack Battle Royal made their entrances. Komander entered the scene, followed by Big Bill and Lee Moriarty, who positioned themselves at ringside. Penelope Ford led The Butcher, The Blade, and Kip Sabian to the ring, while Jay White and Juice Robinson made their joint entrance. Dustin Rhodes arrived on his own, and Keith Lee followed suit, making a grand entrance of his own.</p><p>Ricky Starks made his way to the ring, captivating the crowd with his presence. Alex Abrahantes guided Rey Fenix and Penta El Zero Miedo onto the stage, with “the little Lucha Brothers” joining them briefly before heading backstage. Prince Nana appeared with Brian Cage, and Swerve Strickland joined them in their entrance. Lastly, Orange Cassidy concluded the pre-show with his trademark nonchalant entrance, calmly walking past Nana, Cage, and Strickland, ready for the upcoming battle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>AEW Double Or Nothing Pay-Per-View</h2><p>The main card kicked off with an exciting video package, setting the tone for the event. The broadcast team, consisting of Jim Ross, Excalibur, and Taz, continued to provide commentary, while Justin Roberts resumed his role as the ring announcer. The electrifying spectacle began as pyrotechnics ignited on the stage, further intensifying the atmosphere in the arena.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blackjack Battle Royale for the AEW International Championship</h2><p>As the champion, Orange Cassidy made his entrance into the ring, surrounded by the multitude of challengers vying for his title. Among the challengers were Jay White, Juice Robinson, Keith Lee, Dustin Rhodes, Ricky Starks, Brian Cage, Swerve Strickland, Penta El Zero Miedo, Rey Fenix, Kip Sabian, Trent Beretta, Chuck Taylor, Tony Nese, Ari Daivari, Big Bill, Lee Moriarty, Komander, Bandido, The Butcher, and The Blade.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>With all the competitors positioned at ringside, Kip Sabian took the initiative and entered the ring, attempting to eliminate Cassidy by throwing him over the top rope. However, Cassidy demonstrated his agility by executing a “skin the cat” maneuver, managing to prevent himself from being eliminated. The match was off to an exciting start, full of potential surprises and intense competition.</p><p>Komander showcased his acrobatic skills by performing a rope walk and a daring dive onto several wrestlers on the outside. The broadcast team took note that Komander had yet to officially enter the ring, meaning he was not in danger of being eliminated at that point.</p><p>Swerve Strickland and Brian Cage stood on the ramp, biding their time before entering the match. Cage was the first to make his way into the ring, coinciding with Ari Daivari’s elimination. Cage displayed his immense power by executing an impressive move on both Bandido and Komander. Penta El Zero Miedo and Rey Fenix worked together to target Cage, attempting to gain the upper hand. However, when White and Robinson attempted to press Komander over their heads, Penta and Fenix intervened, saving Komander from elimination.</p><p>As Komander climbed the ropes and started to walk along them, Jay White abruptly shoved him to the floor, eliminating him from the match. Chuck Taylor eliminated Kip Sabian, followed by a group hug from The Best Friends, only to be blindsided by Big Bill. Taz humorously remarked that people often question why Big Bill is called Big Bill, to which he provided the enlightening explanation that Bill is his name and he happens to be big.</p><p>Big Bill proceeded to eliminate Taylor, while Keith Lee eliminated The Blade. Swerve Strickland, who had been lingering at ringside with Prince Nana, finally entered the ring. Strickland attempted to choke out Keith Lee, but Lee swiftly threw him off. Strickland and Cage briefly joined forces against Lee, creating a tumultuous three-way encounter. Penta and Fenix, working together, eliminated The Butcher, while Lee Moriarty managed to eliminate Bandido from the match.</p><p>As the match progressed, Beretta eliminated Lee Moriarty, showcasing his prowess in the ring. Big Bill had Orange Cassidy on the apron, preparing to deliver a big boot, but Beretta selflessly shoved Cassidy out of harm’s way, sacrificing himself in the process and getting eliminated by Big Bill’s impactful boot. Brian Cage eliminated Keith Lee, while Penta accidentally eliminated his own brother, Fenix, in a moment of miscommunication. Ricky Starks successfully eliminated Juice Robinson.</p><p>Jay White executed his signature Switchblade move on Penta and attempted to eliminate him, but before he could, Starks speared White and eliminated him instead. Robinson retaliated by pulling Starks under the bottom rope and delivering punches until referees intervened. White, not one to let things slide, ran Starks into the ringside barricade. Starks managed to crawl back into the ring but was ultimately eliminated by Big Bill’s powerful boot. Dustin Rhodes eliminated Cage with a destructive Destroyer maneuver on the apron, only for Strickland to knock Dustin off the apron, eliminating him.</p><p>The final four competitors left in the ring were Orange Cassidy, Penta El Zero Miedo, Swerve Strickland, and Big Bill. The stakes were high as the match approached its thrilling conclusion.</p><p>Penta El Zero Miedo unleashed a series of kicks on Big Bill, who countered with a clothesline that sent Penta over the top rope, eliminating him from the match. Big Bill then executed a powerful sidewalk slam on Orange Cassidy, momentarily appearing to be on the same page as Swerve Strickland. However, their alliance was short-lived, as Strickland attempted to pick up Cassidy, only to be stopped by Big Bill. Bill proceeded to press Cassidy over his head, but Strickland struck him from behind, causing Bill to be eliminated.</p><p>With the final two competitors being Orange Cassidy and Swerve Strickland, the tension heightened as they took turns executing “skin the cat” maneuvers to avoid elimination. Cassidy delivered a Stundog Millionaire on Strickland, but Strickland quickly rebounded and struck Cassidy with a powerful kick to the side of the head. The crowd erupted into a “this is awesome” chant, a testament to the thrilling nature of the battle royal.</p><p>In a surprising turn of events, Strickland performed a top-rope double stomp on Cassidy. Strickland then placed Cassidy’s hands inside Cassidy’s own pockets, which prompted the crowd to chant “you f—ed up.” However, Cassidy retaliated by unleashing back-to-back DDTs on Strickland. Cassidy followed up with the Orange Punch, which sent Strickland over the top rope, but he managed to remain on the apron.</p><p>Cassidy attempted another Orange Punch, but Strickland evaded it and brought Cassidy onto the apron with him. Cassidy backed Strickland into the turnbuckle, and Prince Nana grabbed Cassidy’s legs, momentarily aiding Strickland’s offensive control. Strickland went for a top-rope double stomp, but Cassidy cleverly raised his feet, causing Strickland to hit the mat. Cassidy then kicked Strickland’s hand, resulting in Strickland falling to the mat, thus concluding the match.</p><p><strong>Orange Cassidy emerged as the winner of the Blackjack Battle Royale, successfully retaining the AEW International Championship.</strong> The crowd erupted in excitement, celebrating Cassidy’s hard-fought victory.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The stage was set for the highly anticipated unsanctioned match as a video package provided a compelling setup. The entrances for the match commenced, accompanied by the powerful sounds of “Judas” filling the arena. Chris Jericho, accompanied by Matt Menard, Angelo Parker, Daniel Garcia, and Jake Hager, made their way to the ring, donning their match gear. Jericho notably carried his baseball bat with him, adding an extra layer of intensity to the proceedings. The atmosphere was charged with anticipation as the competitors prepared for the intense battle that lay ahead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Adam Cole (w/Sabu, Roderick Strong) vs. Chris Jericho (w/Matt Menard, Angelo Parker, Daniel Garcia, Jake Hager) in an unsanctioned match</h2><p><br>Inside the ring, Adam Cole and Chris Jericho immediately engaged in a heated exchange of punches, showcasing their intense rivalry. Cole gained the upper hand momentarily by throwing Jericho to the ringside area. Not accompanied by the wrestlers who initially entered with them, the two competitors continued their battle outside the ring.</p><p>Cole attempted a high-risk maneuver, the Panama Sunrise, on the apron, but Jericho managed to counter and suplex Cole from the apron to the floor, displaying his resilience. Back in the ring, Jericho strategically wedged a chair between the ropes in one corner. Cole evaded a charging Jericho, causing him to collide headfirst into the chair, emphasizing the brutal and unsanctioned nature of the match. The broadcast team humorously acknowledged the lack of liability from AEW for any damages, drawing a lighthearted response.</p><p>Jericho retaliated by subjecting Cole to the Walls of Jericho submission hold, and although Cole managed to reach the ropes, the broadcast team noted that Jericho was not obliged to release the hold given the unsanctioned nature of the match. Determined to break free, Cole reached ringside and grabbed a fire extinguisher, promptly using it to spray Jericho and force him to release the hold.</p><p>Taking advantage of the situation, Cole utilized the fire extinguisher as a weapon, striking Jericho’s head before covering him for a two count. However, Jericho quickly regrouped and retaliated by spraying Cole with the fire extinguisher. Jericho then dropped the fire extinguisher onto Cole’s abdomen, further inflicting damage. Returning to ringside, Jericho retrieved a kendo stick, intent on using it as a weapon.</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, Britt Baker rushed to the ring with her own kendo stick, attacking Jericho. Saraya, another individual who had entered the scene, also fell victim to Baker’s swift strikes. As Saraya retreated from the ring, Baker pursued her backstage, leaving the two competitors alone in the ring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>With the match resuming, Cole utilized the kendo stick as he wrapped it around Jericho’s neck and executed a Backstabber, earning a near fall. Cole then climbed to the top rope, but Jericho reacted swiftly by throwing a chair at his head, causing him to fall off the ropes and crash through a table on the outside floor. Seizing the opportunity, Jericho retrieved a television camera from ringside and proclaimed, “You see what happens when you mess with Chris Jericho.”</p><p>Returning to the ring, Jericho rolled Cole back inside and produced a steel chain from underneath the ring, proceeding to handcuff it to Cole’s wrist. However, Cole managed to deliver a devastating DDT onto the chain, earning a two count. Capitalizing on his advantage, Cole handcuffed the other end of the chain to Jericho’s wrist, preventing him from escaping. Jericho attempted to flee, but Cole yanked the chain and followed up with a superkick. Cole then executed his signature Panama Sunrise maneuver, coming close to securing the victory but only managing a near fall.</p><p>In a critical moment, Chris Jericho managed to avoid Adam Cole’s Boom knee strike, keeping the match suspenseful. However, Cole swiftly recovered, employing his agility to flip over Jericho and deliver two powerful superkicks. Following up with his signature move, the Boom knee, Cole stood up and wrapped the chain around his knee, delivering another devastating knee strike to the back of Jericho’s head.</p><p>Taking control, Cole mounted Jericho and unleashed a barrage of punches, utilizing the chain wrapped around his fist. Jericho, now sporting a bloody eye, found himself unable to defend himself against Cole’s relentless assault. Recognizing the situation, referee Aubrey Edwards made the decision to call for the bell, signifying the end of the match due to Jericho’s inability to continue.</p><p><strong>In a hard-fought battle, Adam Cole emerged victorious over Chris Jericho in the unsanctioned match. </strong>Following the conclusion of the match, crew members entered the ring with bolt cutters, intending to cut Cole and Jericho loose from the chain that bound them together, ensuring their safety and freedom.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The AEW Tag Team Title match was introduced by a compelling video package, providing context and building anticipation for the upcoming clash. As the video concluded, the entrances for the match commenced. The heel team made their way to the ring, holding guitars adorned with the names “Dax” and “Cash” on the back, further emphasizing their presence and branding. The stage was set for a thrilling contest as the teams prepared to compete for the prestigious AEW Tag Team Titles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>“FTR” Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler vs. Jeff Jarrett and Jay Lethal (w/Sonjay Dutt, Satnam Singh, Karen Jarrett) for the AEW Tag Titles with Mark Briscoe as special referee.</h2><p>In a unique attire choice, Briscoe opted for a sleeveless referee shirt, shorts, and a bandana as part of his outfit. FTR attempted to execute double figure-four leg locks on the challengers. However, the challengers managed to reach the ropes, forcing a break and prompting them to roll to ringside to regroup. During this time, Briscoe caught Jay Lethal clapping his hands to simulate a tag, a deceptive move that drew Briscoe’s attention while he was engaged with Dax Harwood. Briscoe quickly realized the ploy and confronted Lethal, leading to a heated exchange.</p><p>At a later point, Jarrett cunningly held the ropes down, causing Wheeler to tumble to the floor. Seizing the opportunity, Jarrett grabbed a chair, but Briscoe intervened, causing Jarrett to drop it. Jarrett retaliated by running Wheeler into the ringside barricade, inflicting damage. The challengers then isolated Wheeler, keeping him at a disadvantage for a significant period of time. Jarrett took advantage of the situation by placing Wheeler over the middle rope and choking him, but Briscoe eventually intervened to halt his actions.</p><p>Adding to the chaos, Karen Jarrett, Jeff Jarrett’s wife, reached into the ring and choked Wheeler over the rope while Briscoe was occupied with her husband. The involvement of Karen introduced a new dimension of interference and underhanded tactics into the match, further complicating the situation for FTR.</p><p>In a back-and-forth contest, the action intensified as the match progressed. Jeff Jarrett displayed his showmanship by flipping off Dax Harwood before executing his signature strut. Jay Lethal tagged in and delivered a neckbreaker to Wheeler, going for a pinfall, but only securing a two-count. Lethal continued his offensive by punching Harwood off the apron, preventing him from being available for a tag later on. Jarrett took the opportunity to enter the ring and apply the figure-four leg lock on Wheeler.</p><p>Harwood managed to reach the ropes, breaking the hold after Jarrett’s figure four. Determined to turn the tide, Harwood executed suplexes and a brainbuster on Lethal, nearly securing the victory. Jarrett ran Wheeler into the ring post, and Harwood shoved Chris Jericho off the apron. Lethal, capitalizing on the situation, chopped Harwood, causing him to fall from the ropes. Lethal attempted a top-rope elbow, but Harwood recovered in time to superplex him.</p><p>FTR unleashed their devastating Doomsday powerbomb on Lethal, leaving him vulnerable. Wheeler performed a suicide dive on Jarrett but appeared to injure his knee in the process. Harwood covered Lethal, but Sonjay Dutt pulled Harwood to ringside. Mark Briscoe, the referee, spotted the interference and ejected Dutt and his accomplice, Gama Singh, from ringside. Jarrett, in an attempt to strike Harwood with a guitar, accidentally hit Briscoe instead.</p><p>FTR executed their signature move, the Big Rig, on Lethal, with Harwood pinning him. However, Briscoe was still recovering, prompting Aubrey Edwards to rush to the ring. Dutt obstructed Edwards momentarily, but she forcefully pushed him aside. Karen Jarrett, Jeff Jarrett’s wife, then struck Edwards with a guitar. Inside the ring, Lethal countered with a Lethal Injection on Harwood and Wheeler.</p><p>Shortly after, Jarrett struck Harwood with one of the title belts, only for Chris Jericho to hit Jarrett with the Stroke. Briscoe, who had awoken from his daze, made a slow count, allowing Harwood to kick out at the last possible moment. Jarrett grew frustrated and started taking shots at Briscoe, leading to a heated exchange. In the midst of the chaos, Jarrett stumbled into FTR’s Big Rig and was pinned by Harwood.</p><p><strong>“FTR” Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler emerged victorious over the team of Jeff Jarrett and Jay Lethal, successfully retaining the AEW Tag Team Titles.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In the backstage area, Ricky Starks was interviewed by Alex Marvez, discussing his elimination of Jay White and Juice Robinson.
