Julian Finney/Getty Images</p><p>The Big 4 in tennis refers to four of the best male tennis players: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray. Now we will take a more in-depth look into the legacy of these players and how their careers and accomplishments stack up.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Roger Federer</h2><p>Born August 8, 1981, in Basel, Switzerland, Federer is known for his fluid play and steady consistency. Federer enjoyed a successful career, and he has become well known for his collection of 20 Grand Slam titles, more than any other male player in history.&nbsp;He is perhaps best remembered for his trailblazing accomplishments on the court and his graceful and multifaceted playing that captured the imagination of thousands of tennis fans internationally.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Rafael Nadal</h2><p>Rafael Nadal, born on June 3, 1986, in his own eyes, has popularized dominance on the clay surface. Because of his aggressive baseline play and the fact that he is a specialist on clay courts Nadal, also known as the 'King of Clay,' has claimed 20 Grand Slam titles, tying the 20 that Federer has taken. His on-court tenacity and durability have secured his standing in tennis history.</p><h2>Novak Djokovic</h2><p>Novak Djokovic, born May 22, 1987, out of Belgrade, Serbia, he is arguably the greatest tennis player in history. Djokovic is perhaps the most complete player tennis has seen in the modern era given his extraordinary defense and his ironclad head. Djokovic, who owns 20 Grand Slam titles, has been widely admired for his consistency and his capacity to come back from the brink, solidifying his position among the greatest of all time. But what distinguishes him from the rest is his single-minded dedication to being the best, and his ability to take that mindset into every sort of condition.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Andy Murray</h2><p>Born May 15, 1987, in Glasgow, Scotland, Andy Murray is known for his precise and relentless style of play and for his historic victories, which include three grand slam titles. Murray's grit and tactical smarts have put him among an elite group in tennis history, tasked with shaping the game and ensuring his legacy as one of the most influential contributors to the tennis world.</p><h2>Introducing Arthur Fils</h2><p>In a career that overlapped with the greats such as Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray, we got another one in the form of Arthur Fils in tennis. The youngster from France was born on 15th April 2003 and has shown great promise and has drawn the attention of tennis fans around the world with his court awareness, ball-striking ability, and fighting qualities.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Career and Accomplishments</h2><p>Fils has had an impressive rise in his blossoming career with several big wins across multiple events and a total prize earnings of more than $1.2 Million. The way he is surging from the world of tennis means that he could be one of the best tennis players of all time and is simply a sign of what the future holds for the sport.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Legacy and Impact</h2><p>When the legacies of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray are reassessed, their scope appears to transcend simply what they achieved on a tennis court. Young players have been inspired to take up the mantle - people like Arthur.<br data-mce-fragment=1>The 'Big 4' in tennis terms of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray have all defined the game with these continued careers and their lasting legacies. With the tennis landscape appearing to change greatly shortly, players as talented and enthusiastic as Fils bode well for a smooth transition from the 'Big 4' era to the next generation of tennis dominance.<br data-mce-fragment=1>But everybody who watched or is playing tennis can feel the lasting legacy that the 'Big 4' had, and it is more than the number of grand slams. While we commemorate the success of these legends and look forward to the dawn of fresh faces, the competitive and sporting spirit of the 'Big 4' lives on; with a determination to preserve their legacy through the ever-changing spectrum of the game that is tennis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mirnqaensBww8eaq2acn5rAbsDHnmSboZdigW65xJqlZqGeYsGmus2iqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-the-big-4-mean-in-tennis.html&text=What%20Does%20%26quot%3bThe%20Big%204%26quot%3b%20Mean%20in%20Tennis%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-the-big-4-mean-in-tennis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-the-big-4-mean-in-tennis.html&title=What%20Does%20%26quot%3bThe%20Big%204%26quot%3b%20Mean%20in%20Tennis%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-the-big-4-mean-in-tennis.html&title=What%20Does%20%26quot%3bThe%20Big%204%26quot%3b%20Mean%20in%20Tennis%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-the-big-4-mean-in-tennis.html&title=What%20Does%20%26quot%3bThe%20Big%204%26quot%3b%20Mean%20in%20Tennis%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-the-big-4-mean-in-tennis.html&description=What%20Does%20%26quot%3bThe%20Big%204%26quot%3b%20Mean%20in%20Tennis%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amanda-batula-discusses-her-relationship-with-lindsay-hubbard-following-her-wwhl-debut.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Batula Discusses Her Relationship With Lindsay Hubbard Following Her WWHL Debut">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./roberto-carlos-what-clubs-soccer-aid.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What clubs did Roberto Carlos play for and when did he retire?
