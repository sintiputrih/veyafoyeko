Simpson and her husband have spent years renovating the 2.5-acre property, which has six bedrooms,&nbsp;a playground, a basketball court, and a huge pool.</p><p>Based on recent comparable transactions, this property is now worth $15–20 million.</p><h4>Beverly Hills home</h4><p>In addition, Simpson previously owned a property in Beverly Hills, which she purchased for $5.265 million in 2005.</p><p>In detail, the property has 5 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms and is spread out across 5,500 square feet. The home includes a flagstone terracing and a courtyard entrance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/jessica-house-in-beverly.jpg><p>Likewise, there is a lap pool in the backyard, which is rather private. Ms. Simpson has elegantly designed the interiors, and it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into the design of this home.</p><p>Also, in the family room, there is a jukebox that we feel may be removed. The house’s interior walls are painted white, harnessing the filtered light and distributing it throughout the space.</p><p>Later, in October 2013, she sold this home for $6.4 million.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Jessica Simpson’s heavy net worth allows her to have luxurious car collections. Some of them are given below:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cadillac Escalade</strong></td><td>$74,695 – $96,795</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bentley Continental GTC Milliner</strong></td><td>$200,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Range Rover</strong></td><td>$89,000 – $177,000</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Mercedes-Benz ML</h4><p>Who knows where the woman’s energy comes from. We do, however, know how she gets around town. Her Mercedes-Benz ML is her way of travel.</p><p>Mercedes-mid-size Benz’s crossover SUVs, the ML, are the most recent iteration. The current iteration offers additional legroom and movable backrests in the rear seats than prior models.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jessica-Simpson-Mercedes-cars.jpg><p>Specifically, the car is powered by a 3.5 L V6 engine, a 4.6 L V8 engine, or a 5.5 L V8 engine, depending on the model.</p><p>The car costs between $50,000 and $100,000, depending on the options.</p><p>Jessica and her family have recently purchased their third SUV, so it’s safe to assume they’re planning on having a few more children.</p><h4>Cadillac Escalade</h4><p>Jessica Simpson, who is extremely wealthy, enjoys driving her white Cadillac Escalade. It is a high-end SUV that is sold in the United States.</p><p>The automobile is flashy and youthful, and it complements Ms. Simpson’s image well. The 6.2-liter V8 engine produces more than 400 horsepower, and the interior has some of the most advanced amenities ever seen in a car.</p><p>However, several critics have slammed the vehicle, claiming that the ride quality is poor. The actress, on the other hand, may disagree!</p><h4>Bentley Continental GTC Mulliner</h4><p>Jessica used to drive a Bentley Mulliner for up to three years before getting her Cadillac. The outside is metallic black, and the inside is gorgeous, with a steering wheel that spins. She adored driving this car, but she eventually let it go.</p><h4>Range Rover</h4><p>Jessica Simpson seemed to prefer her Range Rover when she goes out with her fiance Eric Johnson.</p><p>Due to the use of an aluminum chassis is substantially lighter (up to 200 kg), and the four-wheel-drive system, along with an 8-speed transmission and a 335 horsepower V8 diesel engine, ensures a smooth yet powerful ride.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jessica-Simpson-Range-Rover-cars.jpg><p>Also, the SUV can go from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 6.3 seconds. It also comes with a 503 horsepower petrol engine, which is significantly more powerful.</p><h2>Jessica Simpson: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Simpson lives a very fashionable, luxurious, and healthy lifestyle. Being a mother herself, she also maintains her body just so young.</p><p>Jessica Simpson has come a long way from her days as a pop singer to her days as a reality show star to her current status as a business magnate.</p><p>There are around 31 product categories in the fashion and lifestyle business empire, which can be found in hundreds of locations across the United States.</p><p>While other celebrities’ fashion brands failed, Jessica Simpson has remained on top and has immensely aided her success.</p><p>When it comes to moisturizers, Simpson recommends two high-end options. Jessica told InStyle that her skin was consistently dry during her three pregnancies.</p><p>Likewise, Jessica hasn’t revealed her favorite eye cream, but she has revealed her holy grail serum, Epicuren Discovery Bio Peptide Serum, which she equates to “gold” for her complexion.</p><p>Also, Jessica, an obvious Epicuren fan, has declared that their Kukui Coconut After Bath Moisturizer is her favorite body lotion on her blog.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>Jessica has always enjoyed traveling and continues to do so. She’s been to many incredible places, and she’s often traveled with the man she was dating at the time or another significant character in her life.</p><p>Likewise, Jessica’s excursions are with her husband and children, and she continues to create new memories.</p><p>Moreover, Simpson has already been on the road a lot this year, even though we’re all spending March at home.</p><p>The actress toured the country to promote her new book,<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong> Open Book</strong></a>, in which she details her most personal challenges for the first time since breaking into the spotlight at the age of 15.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eric-Johnson-Jessica-Simpson.jpg><p>For the final leg of her tour, Simpson was a guest speaker at the prestigious Create & Cultivate conference, and Travel + Leisure had the opportunity to interview her there.</p><p>“My book tour has been fantastic, and I’ve met admirers from all across the country who have encouraged me and reinforced my decision to write this book,”</p><p>Simpson said. “I wanted to demonstrate to people that accepting imperfections and anxieties leads to a far more beautiful and peaceful world.
