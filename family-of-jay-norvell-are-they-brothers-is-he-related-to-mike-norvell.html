After a year, the football coach suffered another devastating loss when his father, Merritt, died.</p><h2><span id=Merritt_Served_as_Jays_Life_Coach>Merritt Served as Jay’s Life Coach</span></h2><p>Merritt was a gifted and well-educated individual. He obtained his Ph.D., for example, from the University of Wisconsin. In the 1960s, he also played halfback for the Wisconsin Badgers.
