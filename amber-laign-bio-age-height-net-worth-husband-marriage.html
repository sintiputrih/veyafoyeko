She is a 48-year-old prominent personality who spent her youth in Lebanon, New Jersey, when her family relocated there when she was a baby. Amber finished her studies at Round Valley Middle School and subsequently graduated from Clayton Valley High School while living there. She was a color guard captain in her school’s marching band when she was in school. Later that year, in 2008-2009, she finished a one-year program at The Swedish Institute of Health Sciences.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amber-laign-height-weight></span>Amber Laign Height & Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In terms of body measurements, she is a pretty girl with an amazing and cool personality. Amber Laign is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs around 58 kilograms. She has a nice body figure and is in good health. Her hair is brown, and she has brown eyes.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amber-laign-net-worth></span>Amber Laign Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>How much is Amber Laign’s net worth? </b>Amber earns a nice living via her eCommerce website, where she offers wellness items. Since then, partnering with Marci Freed for years has resulted in a net worth of $1.2 million USD as of May 2023, which many people find intriguing. But that is real, and she has become a billionaire solely through her own hard work. Amber has kept her social media accounts secret, so she hasn’t shared much about her lavish lifestyle. However, according to Robins’ story, they have both been photographed traveling outside of their state to several gorgeous towns and beaches.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When it comes to Amber’s job, she is a professional Massage Therapist. Amber formerly worked as a Sales Representative in a showroom in New York called Berger and Stevens at the start of her struggle. For the next nine years, she has worked as a Sales Representative there. She gained a lot of sales experience and then went to the Swedish Institute of Health Sciences for a year to study how to be a massage therapist. Amber then proceeded to provide deep tissue, Swedish, myofascial release, and trigger point massages to clients.</p><p>Amber explored the advantages of essential oils and how they supported the human body between 2007 and 2012 when her spouse was diagnosed with breast cancer and bone cancer. She then had the opportunity to meet Mrs. Marci Freede, an advocate for essential oils, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Mrs. Freede is an artist and the owner of an essential oil company. Amber began her own essential oil company, coordinated with Marci Freede, to assist others to nurture their health. She is now making a good living from her company. Plant Juice Oils is the name Amber has given to her company. On her website, Plantjuiceoils.com, you can discover a variety of items such as cream, soft gels, oils, and many more that she typically sells for $10-$50 USD.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amber-laign-husband-marriage></span>Amber Laign Husband & Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Who is Amber Laign’s husband? </b>Miss. Amber’s love and same-sex partner, Miss. Robin Roberts first met her 17 years ago. Her partner is presently an anchor for the ABC network’s Good Morning America. They met on a blind date in 2005 via a mutual acquaintance. In the interview, Amber’s spouse, Robin, said that Amber was uninterested in sports and seldom watched sporting events. Prior to their initial encounter, she had never seen Robin on ESPN or ABC.</p><p>Roberts said that the major thing that has been consistent between them too far is their good vibe toward one other. Since 2005, I’ve been dating Amber. Robin first revealed her relationship secret to the public in 2013 when she made a Facebook post. Robin thanks everyone who helped her through her difficult cancer treatment in a Facebook post. She praised her sister and Amber there. At the time, it was unknown that Amber and Robin knew one other and had ties. Robin and Amber are still together now, although they prefer to live apart during the week. They did this because they believed it would help them maintain their relationship for a long time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmdl7KzecuaoKCmXZe2sHnAoJxmoJWetKnAjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyhrKyakaOxbrnAq6mimZeafA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famber-laign-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html&text=Amber%20Laign-%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Husband%2c%20Marriage&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famber-laign-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famber-laign-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html&title=Amber%20Laign-%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Husband%2c%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famber-laign-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html&title=Amber%20Laign-%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Husband%2c%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famber-laign-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html&title=Amber%20Laign-%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Husband%2c%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famber-laign-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html&description=Amber%20Laign-%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Husband%2c%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-hanks-diet-cokagne-coke-champagne-cocktail-taste-test.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I tried Tom Hanks' 'Diet Cokagne' cocktail with champagne and cola - I don't get the hype, it's a wa">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./peach-recipes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Easy Peach Recipes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
