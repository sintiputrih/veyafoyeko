The Fox News Channel anchor adopted Maria in 2008 when she was only 3 years old. She revealed that it was probably the best thing that she had ever done. Even though Laura has remained in the public eyes for almost always, she has managed to keep Maria and her two other kids away from the public.</p><p>Although the exact date of the birth of Maria Caroline Ingraham is not known, it is known that she was adopted by Laura Ingraham in May 2008. At the time, Maria was said to be 3 years old but the identity of her biological parents is still missing from the public domain.</p><p>Laura adopted her daughter from an orphanage in Guatemala and after the adoption, she changed her name to Maria Caroline Ingraham from a name that is also missing from public records.</p><p>Maria was brought up in the United States alongside two siblings who were also adopted by the news anchor. Inasmuch as Laura Ingraham has managed to keep details about Maria and her other kids under the radar, here are some facts to know about Maria.</p><h2><strong>6 Riveting Facts About Maria Caroline Ingraham</strong></h2><h4><strong>1. Her mother is Laura Ingraham of Fox News</strong></h4><p>It was on June 19, 1963, that Laura Anne Ingraham was born in Glastonbury, Connecticut, U.S. Brought up in a very humble background, she got her education from the Glastonbury High School which was the only high school in the town where she grew up. After graduating in 1981, she proceeded to the Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire from where she graduated in 1985.</p><p>As regards her career, her first work in the 1980s was with the Reagan administration with which she served as a speechwriter. She also worked with The Prospect magazine as an editor. In the years that followed, Ingraham worked on both TV with networks like MSNBC and Fox News as well as on radio with XM Satellite Radio. With XM Satellite, she launched The Laura Ingraham Show in 2011 before she later moved to Talk Radio Network.</p><h4><strong>2. She Has Two Other Siblings</strong></h4><p>Maria Caroline Ingraham was brought up alongside two siblings as the oldest and the only girl. Just like her, her brothers were also adopted by Laura Ingraham.</p><p>A year after Maria was adopted, Ingraham adopted her next child, Michael Dmitri from Moscow, Russia in 2009. At the time, Michael was only 13 months old. Two years after Michael’s adoption, the famous media personality adopted yet another child, Nikolai Peter Ingraham, increasing the number of her children to three. Nikolai was also adopted from Russia.</p><p>Before deciding to adopt her kids, Ingraham revealed in an interview that the moment she began spending time with her friend’s kids, the sense of motherhood in her was ignited and she wanted to have kids.</p><h4><strong>3. Laura Is The Only Parent She Has</strong></h4><p>Because the famous TV host has never been married, Maria and her two brothers have grown up with her as an only parent. Interestingly, though, parenting is something the TV host seems to be good at.</p><p>Relationship wise, Ingram has been in a good number of relationships in the past, dating men like Keith Olbermann, Dinesh D’Souza who was also said to have dated Ann Coulter, and James Reyes to whom she was once engaged before they called off the engagement and ended the relationship. She was said to have also dated former U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli, but like all others, the relationship did not go far.</p><h4><strong>4. Maria Is Multilingual</strong></h4><p>As stated, Maria Caroline Ingraham was adopted from Guatemala when she was 3 and so she understands Spanish. In addition to that, she has also learned English pretty fast.</p><h4><strong>5. Her Mom’s Net Worth is Impressive</strong></h4><p>Maria and her siblings are raised in affluence considering that Laura Ingraham has an enviable fortune. She has a net worth that has been estimated at $45 million. Needless to say, Ingraham made her enticing fortune from her very successful career as a media person who has worked with some major networks through the years as well as from her other engagements.</p><h4><strong>6. Maria Maintains a Very Private Life</strong></h4><p>In the same way as her brothers, Maria Caroline Ingraham maintains a very private life as they are always shielded by their mother. Because of this, personal information about her like her height, dating history, and similar things are not known.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35uucCroJplk5a%2FsLjIp5xmoZ6cv6K0wKZkb2WWlrC1v4yamaitpGK5osHRmmSippenrqmtzKxknZmlnLW1sdFo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2021-maria-caroline-ingraham-6-facts-about-laura-ingrahams-daughter.html&text=Maria%20Caroline%20Ingraham%20%206%20Facts%20About%20Laura%20Ingrahams%20Daughter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2021-maria-caroline-ingraham-6-facts-about-laura-ingrahams-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2021-maria-caroline-ingraham-6-facts-about-laura-ingrahams-daughter.html&title=Maria%20Caroline%20Ingraham%20%206%20Facts%20About%20Laura%20Ingrahams%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2021-maria-caroline-ingraham-6-facts-about-laura-ingrahams-daughter.html&title=Maria%20Caroline%20Ingraham%20%206%20Facts%20About%20Laura%20Ingrahams%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2021-maria-caroline-ingraham-6-facts-about-laura-ingrahams-daughter.html&title=Maria%20Caroline%20Ingraham%20%206%20Facts%20About%20Laura%20Ingrahams%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2021-maria-caroline-ingraham-6-facts-about-laura-ingrahams-daughter.html&description=Maria%20Caroline%20Ingraham%20%206%20Facts%20About%20Laura%20Ingrahams%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rey-grupero-wikipedia-bio-and-edad-how-old-is-he.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rey Grupero Wikipedia Bio And Edad  How Old Is He?
