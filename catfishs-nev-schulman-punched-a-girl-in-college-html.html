In both, he is an affable romantic, tirelessly crusading for the internet’s lonely hearts, kindly helping reassemble their spirits when the people they fall in love with don’t turn out to be who they said they were. But his account also clashes with the version of events we heard from other people present that night, as well as from the woman Schulman punched.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-acd07bce534c89e220d1a2a5bd0c3275-5-0-0@published data-word-count=9>Here’s how Schulman describes the incident in&nbsp;<i>In Real Life</i>:</p><p>I decided to photograph the school’s annual Sleaze Ball, a night of debauchery, drugs, and girls dressed primarily in lingerie. While I was photographing, an individual who didn’t like that I was taking pictures attempted to tackle me and smash my camera on the ground. Since the camera was attached to a strap around my neck, I found myself in a very unpleasant situation, much like a dog with a choke collar. In an effort to free myself, I punched the person and ran off; when I returned minutes later, I discovered that the short, stocky, crew-cut-styled individual that I’d fought with was a woman—a fact I hadn’t been aware of in the heat of the moment. The next thing I knew, I’d been arrested.</p><p>The case was dismissed almost immediately, but Sarah Lawrence took the opportunity to toss me out once and for all. I never even finished my junior year. My attitude was, “Never mind. No big deal. I had it coming.” It didn’t matter much to me. But my mom was crushed. She’d always put her neck out for me more times than I could count, and now I was hurting her legacy at the school she loved so much. I’d finally screwed up so badly that it ended her relationship with Sarah Lawrence for good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-acd07bce534c89e220d1a2a5bd0c3275-7-0-0@published data-word-count=29><a href=#>Rumors</a>&nbsp;of this&nbsp;<a href=#>incident</a>&nbsp;have cropped up across the internet in various forms over the years, and students we spoke with tell the story in a much different way than Schulman does.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-acd07bce534c89e220d1a2a5bd0c3275-8-0-0@published data-word-count=36>Vulture spoke with the woman Nev attacked, and she provided a detailed statement of the incident. Her statement matches the description of events given to us by four other Sarah Lawrence students who attended the dance.</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-GCtPzl06"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Here’s How MTV’s <i>Catfish</i> Actually Works</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-acd07bce534c89e220d1a2a5bd0c3275-10-0-0@published data-word-count=50>On April 28, 2006, during his junior year at Sarah Lawrence, Schulman — a photography and dance student — decided to take pictures at the Sleaze Ball, a coming-out dance celebrating LGBTQ students held at Bates, the campus’s cafeteria. The student Schulman assaulted, who wished to remain anonymous, tells us:</p><p>To be quite clear, Schulman’s account of the events of that night is as suspect as all his other endeavors. I attended the dance he mentions and saw that he was taking pictures of queer couples dancing and kissing without their permission. I talked to the Student Affairs liaison at the event, who I knew from my work study job, but nothing was done about it. I confronted him, and asked him to stop taking pictures. I didn’t tackle him and I certainly didn’t choke him with his camera strap. I tapped his shoulder and he turned and hit me out of nowhere, I went down and he held me in a head lock and repeatedly punched me while I tried to get free. The impact broke my glasses and the rest of the night was a blur. I got off the floor, talked to police, then went home to sleep. When I woke up the next day, my face was bruised, I was hurt, and a friend urged me to go to the hospital, which I did.</p><p>From the hospital, I was directed to legal services and received legal advice. I was advised not to press charges because it would be a difficult case to win, as I didn’t have any broken bones and it would be his word against mine. I also felt intimidated because his lawyer had been waiting for me in the parking lot after my legal meeting. I didn’t talk to him but it was clear that Nev’s family had the means to drag me through a lengthy court case. As an LBGT financial aid student I didn’t think the chance of getting justice looked good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-acd07bce534c89e220d1a2a5bd0c3275-12-0-0@published data-word-count=49>The anonymous student&nbsp;<a href=#>published</a>&nbsp;a post to Facebook the day after the incident took place, which provides more detail.

punch. “And a lot of people think Nev tweeted that knowing that it was in his book.” He essentially made the “right” PR move, the student suggested, by getting ahead of the press and addressing the
