Of course, like most “reality” TV stars, it turns out there is more to Todd than meets the eye. In fact, it turns out that <a href=#>Todd has a lot of dark secrets</a> that he has tried to keep out of the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Appeared On Reality TV With Their Parents</a></span></p><p>At the end of the day, most people agree that the thing that matters most in life is family, whether that means the people they are born with or the ones they choose. For that reason, it makes sense that there are a lot of “reality” shows about family. Still, there can only be one first family of “reality” TV. Unfortunately, when it comes to the Chrisley family, it is a shame that one of Todd’s secrets revolve around his family. For example, <a href=#>Todd has kept his controversial sibling out of the spotlight</a>. On the other hand, Todd has addressed his strained relationship with his daughter many times which has left fans wondering what Lindsie is really doing now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-todd-chrisley-disown-his-daughter-lindsie-chrisley>Why Did Todd Chrisley Disown His Daughter Lindsie Chrisley?</h2><p>In an ideal world, everyone would be able to turn to their parents to receive the right kind of love and support. In reality, however, there are far too many people out there who have been estranged from their parents for years. For example, it is well known that some celebrities have feuded with their parents including Lindsie Chrisley since she has been estranged from her father Todd for many years at this point.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebs Who Have Rocky Relationships With Their Fathers (Besides Britney Spears)</a></span></p><p>When it comes to the rift that exists between them, the reasons for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd and Lindsie Chrisley’s long-lasting feud</a> are mindblowing to say the least. After all, their feud includes accusations of criminal activity and infidelity. According to Todd, the family rift began when Lindsie opted to elope with Will Campbell since he felt disrespected. While Todd’s disappointment in that development was understandable and even relatable, the next step in the family feud was far more shocking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late-2019, Todd Chrisley revealed that he and his wife had been indicted by a grand jury in Georgia on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. Even though it had been years since Lindsie had last appeared on Chrisley Knows Best at that time, she was soon drawn into the drama. After all, Lindsie filed a police report claiming that her father and brother Todd threatened to release a private and intimate recording of her unless she helped her parents fight the criminal charges. Ultimately, Todd Chrisley would make a deal that allowed him to put an end to the criminal case against him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Reality Stars Who've Done Time In Jail (& Why)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Lindisie filed the aforementioned police report, it didn’t take Todd Chrisley long to fire back as he would publicly accuse her of cheating on her husband with two <a href=#>Bachelor</a> stars. In the years since Todd and Lindsie initially exchanged accusations, there have been many more chapters to their feud including holiday snubs. With all of that in mind, it isn’t surprising in the least that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsie said she would “never” reconcile with her family</a> during an Entertainment Tonight interview.</p><h2 id=what-has-lindsie-chrisley-done-since-being-estranged-from-her-father-chris>What Has Lindsie Chrisley Done Since Being Estranged From Her Father Chris?</h2><p>After Lindise Chrisley and Will Campbell married in 2012, they separated and then got back together several times in the years that followed. Alternatively, Lindsie and Will were also known to publically profess their love at times, they had a son together, and in 2020 she stated that they were planning to try to have another child. In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindisie announced that her roller-coaster marriage to Will was coming to an end</a> and they would go on to finalize their divorce in October.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After attending Georgia State University, Lindsie Chrisley graduated with a degree in marketing. As it turns out, it seems like Lindsie’s marketing degree is coming in handy as she has been trying to garner attention for herself as she tries to build a career in entertainment.</p><p>Even though it has been several years since she made her last Chrisley Knows Best appearance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindise Chrisley has recently been trying to capitalize on her past TV fame</a>. The main way she is doing that is by launching “Coffee Convos”, a podcast she co-hosts with Teen Mom’s Kailyn Lowry. During each “Coffee Convos” episode, Lindsie and Kailyn discuss being women, dealing with fame, and being mothers. On top of that, Lindsie and Katy Harrell co-host "The Southern Tea Podcast" which is focused on family, faith, and career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Chrisley Knows Best': Everything We Know About The Family</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOom51lk52%2Fqr%2FLnrCsZZWowbOtzaCcnWWUlsKotNOeqWakmaOxtLXEZpuooZ6cenN8kWtm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-todd-chrisleys-estranged-daughter-lindsie-doing-2022.html&text=What%20Is%20Todd%20Chrisleys%20Estranged%20Daughter%20Lindsie%20Really%20Doing%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-todd-chrisleys-estranged-daughter-lindsie-doing-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-todd-chrisleys-estranged-daughter-lindsie-doing-2022.html&title=What%20Is%20Todd%20Chrisleys%20Estranged%20Daughter%20Lindsie%20Really%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-todd-chrisleys-estranged-daughter-lindsie-doing-2022.html&title=What%20Is%20Todd%20Chrisleys%20Estranged%20Daughter%20Lindsie%20Really%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-todd-chrisleys-estranged-daughter-lindsie-doing-2022.html&title=What%20Is%20Todd%20Chrisleys%20Estranged%20Daughter%20Lindsie%20Really%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-todd-chrisleys-estranged-daughter-lindsie-doing-2022.html&description=What%20Is%20Todd%20Chrisleys%20Estranged%20Daughter%20Lindsie%20Really%20Doing%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-is-bam-margera-on-the-run-manhunt-charges-and-arrest-warrant-explained-622285-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is Bam Margera on the run?
