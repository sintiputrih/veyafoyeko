Ahead of the ninth-season premiere of the Logo reality series, the 13 queens vying for $100,000 and the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar already seem like <a href=#>the show’s most impressive yet</a>. To help you figure out which queen to root for, Vulture did the early prep work to determine who is the most — and least — likely to take home the crown. Will it be Aja? Peppermint? Shea Couleé? Let’s begin.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrxfw001x9vye6usygaxa@published data-word-count=117><strong>Aja<br></strong>This 22-year-old Brooklyn queen, who got her name from <a href=#>a song</a> featured in the 1982 Bollywood film Disco Dancer, draws on a broad range of pop-cultural references to describe herself — “slutty anime girl,” “Gaultier meets Mugler meets, like, furry monsters but pastel” — but even those fail to capture her range as an entertainer. The mother of the <a href=#>Haus of Aja</a> is a tight lip-syncer, handling everyone from <a href=#>Busta Rhymes</a> to <a href=#>Diva Plavalaguna</a> with ease, and embodies a degree of control in her live performances that few queens can claim. There’s a reason she won<a href=#> Drag Queen of the Year</a> at the 2016 Brooklyn Nightlife Awards, not to mention the title of <a href=#>Mr(s) Williamsburg in 2014</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabwg5p002gvdy6vlxauf1f@published data-word-count=48><i>Strengths:</i> Her makeup is flawless, her styling is on point, and her aesthetic is distinct. (Pay no attention to the <a href=#>Naomi Smalls comparisons</a> behind the curtain!) She can dance. She can <a href=#>choreograph</a>. She can even <a href=#>death-drop</a> if she has to. In short, Aja’s got a lot of strengths.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrxbs001w9vyeoaxt0qe9@published data-word-count=34><i>Weaknesses:</i><strong> </strong>Not sure how she’ll fare in the acting and singing challenges, or the impersonation-based Snatch Game.

She’s an experienced parodist, an excellent live singer, a skilled dancer, a consummate professional, and an all-around entertainer with a capital E. Also, the 37-year-old hopes to be the first transgender contestant to take home the crown. Peppermint seems almost serenely confident in her <a href=#>Meet the Queens interview</a>, but will she be able to stay ahead of her competitors? Although most of them have less experience, that might push them to prove themselves against an established performer like herself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrzuy002o9vyehwbxwy81@published data-word-count=38><i>Strengths:</i><strong> </strong>Let’s hope Drag Race brings back the celebrity interview challenge because Peppermint would mop the floor with that one.

Shea Couleé might very well be the one to change that.

(That’s the high-profile title held by Erica Andrews, Roxxxy’s late drag mother, and Mokha Montrese, Coco’s drag mother.)
