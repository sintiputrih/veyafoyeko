The actor turned 53 in February 2022, but looking at her, it can sometimes feel as though <a href=#>she is aging backwards</a>. Aniston has been married twice in her life: to actors <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong> and Justin Theroux. And even if the relationships never lasted, she remained friendly with both of her ex-husbands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the screen, Aniston is best known for her work as Rachel Green in the popular NBC sitcom <a href=#><strong>Friends</strong></a>. Since 2019, she has been back on television in the role of Alex Levy on Apple TV+'s drama series, The Morning Show. All her achievements have come in spite of having had a relatively <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tough time growing up</a>. A potential ray of light from that strained family background for the actress came in the form of a half-brother, called Alex "AJ" Aniston.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘The Morning Show’: Jennifer Aniston Shares Emotional Tribute After Season Two Finale</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-s-parents-divorced-when-she-was-nine><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston's Parents Divorced When She Was Nine</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Aniston was born by two parents who were professional actors themselves. When she was about nine, her father John walked away from her mother, and she was left to deal with the reality of divorce at her very young age.</p><p>The memories of the meanness between her father and her mother created a sense of lack of safety at home for Aniston and have stuck with her even in adulthood.</p><h2 id=how-many-siblings-does-jennifer-aniston-have><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Many Siblings Does Jennifer Aniston Have?</span></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston's mother was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actress and model Nancy Dow</a>, who had previously been married to musician Jack Melick. From that relationship, she had a son called John, who is about ten years older than Jennifer.</p><p>After he divorced Dow, John Aniston went on to get married to Sherry Rooney, with whom he had another son by the name Alex.

Within the film industry, he is also said to have given a shot at screenwriting.</p><p>Things did not work out for him as they did for his other family members, and he left the field to focus on other interests. Alex has worked as a part-time musician, and he has been rumored to have an interest in bikes and turning animal skulls to some type of art.</p><h2 id=alex-aniston-s-dating-history><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alex Aniston's Dating History</span></h2><p>Alex Aniston has been in two known relationships to date.

Their son is called Ryat, and was born in 2014, and his younger sister Kira arrived about two years later.</p><p>Since the breakup between Alex and Adrienne, it is not well known how much the kids get to see their father - or even if they get to meet their extended family on the paternal side.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Celebs Who Have Always Lived In The Shadow Of Their More Famous Siblings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alex-aniston-s-net-worth-in-2022><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Alex Aniston's Net Worth In 2022</span></h2><p>There are contradicting reports online as to how much Alex Aniston is likely to be worth, including some that estimate he could have an estate valued at nearly $10 million.
