He is the second child and only son of the proficient veteran wrestler, <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> and mother <a href=#>Linda Hogan</a>. Nick is well known for his presence on his father’s reality TV show, entitled “Hogan Knows Best”, and the byproduct series, “<a href=#>Brooke</a> Knows Best,” which followed his sister. Nick is also well known for likely all the wrong reasons, like an elitist in the reality show and his bad temper.</p><p>So how rich is Nick Hogan? Well although he is called a star, he hasn’t actually achieved anything prodigious yet to earn such a status, and that is why his net worth is only assessed to be about $500,000.</p><h3>Nick Hogan Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Nick started his career as a reality TV personality in his dad’s reality TV show, “Hogan Knows Best”, as it followed the life of <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> along with his family. It was even followed up with a spin off show, “<a href=#>Brooke</a> Knows Best.” Nick brought in close to $90,000 per episode to jump-start both his net worth, and his career in motor sports.</p><p>At the beginning of Nick’s motor sports career, he would sometimes join substandard drifting contests, and finally in 2006 he attained from Formula Drift the only known certified drifting sequence in Northern America, a Formula D competition authorization. Nick thereafter competed in one of their prestigious contests held on the 12th of May in Atlanta. Moreover he participated in the NOPI Drift series, and he was endorsed as 10th at the 2007 NOPI Drift Event in Denver and third in their event held in Pittsburgh. His net worth improved accordingly.</p><p>Nick’s celebrity prestige and passion for drifting charmed various sponsors. He was then endorsed by Dodge, however this endorsement was short-lived because the spokesman for Dodge issued a statement that “Nick is not a Dodge driver, nor a Mopar Driver.” Despite Nick’s early end at Dodge, sponsors like Mac Tools, Sparco, BF Goodrich and Polaroid still subsidized him for the year 2007.</p><p>Nick’s fame was put on hiatus when he encountered a severe vehicular mishap at Clearwater, Florida, on the 26th night of August 2007. He and three members of his pit crew, took two of his father’s autos – a silver Dodge Viper and a yellow Toyota Supra – for a drive and were alleged to have been racing when the yellow Supra, that Nick had been driving in an inappropriate lane, hurtled across the lane and crashed into a tree. Nick and his 22 year old passenger, John Graziano, were immediately brought to Bayfront Medical Center, Florida. Nick was discharged from the hospital the next day, however Graziano incurred brain and eye injuries, which left him permanently disabled for the rest of his life.</p><p>As a consequence of the car crash, Nick was charged with reckless driving, which involved serious injury to the body (a third degree felony), the use of an automobile in committing the felony, an individual under the age of 21 driving under the influence of alcohol, and the use of unlawful window tint. During his arraignment, Nick submitted a plea of no contest and was sentenced to serve eight months at the Pinellas County Jail, plus probation for five years, five hundred hours of community service, and a suspension of his license to drive for three years.</p><p>Nick was released early because of his good behavior while serving his jail sentence and decided to live in Florida with his mother. He was also permitted timely discharge from probation on May 4, 2012. All these events did little good to his net worth!</p><p>In his personal life, Nick continues to date Breana Tiesi, to whom he has been engaged since 2011, apparently a continuing situation. Currently, he is training to be a wrestler, in the footsteps of his dad, WWE legend <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a>.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Home and Away</td><td>1999</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Constable Jim Woods</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Miscellaneous <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=miscellaneous readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Australia's Funniest Home Video Show</td><td>1990</td><td>TV Series stager</td><td></td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1884538_Nick-Hogan/1884538_Australias-Funniest-Home-Video-Show-1990.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1884538_Nick-Hogan/1884538_Home-and-Away-1999.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqegnKNdnbyorc1mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html&text=Nick%20Hogan%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html&title=Nick%20Hogan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html&title=Nick%20Hogan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html&title=Nick%20Hogan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html&description=Nick%20Hogan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paulina-gretzky-bikini-yacht-europe-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paulina Gretzkys Bikini On A Yacht In Europe: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kevin-gatess-ig-story-and-leaked-video-rapper-melted-twitter-and-reddit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Gatess IG Story and Leaked Video Rapper Melted Twitter and Reddit">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
