A lot has been happening in Mike Berk and Ximena Morales’ relationship with the latter accusing the New York man of abuse while continuing to break her NDA. Ximena’s Instagram posts have been directed towards <a href=#>Mike who allegedly tried to hit</a> her in their relationship which has apparently ended. However, Ximena also posted a photo of her engagement ring&nbsp;and said “gracias” to a fan who congratulated her and Mike in the comments.</p><p>Also, confusing fans about their relationship status are <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a> couple Memphis Sandoval and Hamza Moknii via their IG updates. Memphis keeps posting stories about narcissists&nbsp;amidst speculations of her and Hamza going through a rough phase. Ella Johnson and Johnny’s long-distance romance was threatened by her sleeping with her friend as revealed in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days episode 13. It’s not known if <a href=#>Johnny could make it to the U.S</a>. in February as promised, but Ella has dropped several hints that he’s still her Asian prince. Another B90 cast member who’s not afraid of spoiling her storyline is Kim Menzies.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Why Kim Keeps Spoiling Her Storyline With Usman On IG</a></span></p><p>Kim has no qualms in calling Usman her “yarima” on Instagram posts, while to Usman, Kim will always be his queen. Despite the Zara drama, that is. Meanwhile, Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo seem to have fixed things between them if their social media activity says anything. Although B90 episode 13 may have revealed that Jasmine may never forgive Gino for sending her nudes to his ex, there are chances the couple did get engaged in the finale. <a href=#>Ben Rathbun and Mahogany Roca’s romance</a> is also on shaky ground thanks to her having questions about his past and exes. Spoilers suggest Ben and Mahogany are still together, but how that happens is something 90 Day Fiancé will reveal. Until then, here’s a quick look at the highs and lows of the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days cast from the last week.</p><h2>Memphis Embraces Imperfections In Bold Instagram Update</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>90 Day Fiancé star Memphis is known for calling a spade a spade on Instagram be it with her saying the show is “the devil’s work” or confirming that not everything shown on it is “reality.” However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Memphis</a> is undoubtedly one of the <a href=#>most ridiculed B90 cast members</a> and she’s now revealed that she’s even criticized for her body. “The sad part is being criticized by other women! I hope other women can look at so called ‘imperfections’ and embrace them!” Memphis said in her caption for a post in which she flaunted her bikini body. Memphis called herself a “proud mother of multiple children” perhaps hinting at rumors about her having allegedly given birth to Hamza’s baby daughter recently.</p><h2>Ximena Reveals Where Mike Actually Met Her</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>As told by Mike on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, he and Ximena crossed paths after matching on a dating app. Mike, who had been single for almost all his life at 34, didn’t expect someone as beautiful as Ximena to swipe him right. However, <a href=#>Ximena recently shocked Instagram fans</a> by claiming she really met Mike while working on a webcam site. In a now-deleted comment (via @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">truecrime_jankie</a>) Ximena wrote about how disgusted she was to see Mike naked. However, she ended up accepting his money anyway. As per Ximena, Mike’s money was the “only good thing” about him, and she doesn’t “give a f*** that people now know the truth” of how they met.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: How Much Money Mike Berk Has Spent On Ximena Morales So Far</a></span></p><h2>Kim Issues Apology To Usman’s Ex Zara</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Kim is sorry for calling Usman’s former girlfriend Zara a “b****”, according to her statement on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. Kim found out about Zara from Usman after the couple made their relationship official on <strong>90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days</strong>. <a href=#>Usman came clean to Kim</a> about how he met Zara after he started talking to Kim and confessed how his new song was also about the younger woman. Usman was in a long-distance relationship with Zara, which ended four months before his Zanzibar trip. Kim felt betrayed by Usman having kept his relationship a secret. However, she later realized that she shouldn’t have bashed Zara for it. “I have no excuse except to say I was mad at Usman,” Kim wrote on Instagram, before adding, “I deeply apologize” to her story.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Clues Usman & Kim Will Be The Only Couple To Stay Together</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Memphis Sandoval</a>/Instagram, @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">truecrime_jankie</a>/Instagram, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Menzies</a>/Instagram</p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>90 Day Fiancé: What Happened To Before The 90 Days Cast This Week (Feb. 28)</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Saylee-Padwal-Profile-Picture-New.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Saylee Padwal<br><span class=amount>(2765 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Saylee Padwal is a Features and News Writer for Screen Rant where she covers Reality TV.
