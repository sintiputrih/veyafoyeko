He also won the Greatest Royal Rumble title contest, the Men's Money in the Bank contract match, and the 2019 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, making him the only wrestler to win both a Rumble and an André Battle Royal.</p><p>For the WWE, Strowman has been the main attraction at a number of pay-per-view events, proving his status as a star draw. He has left his mark on history by holding the records for the most eliminations in a single André Battle Royal (14), the most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble match (13), and the most eliminations in an Elimination Chamber match (5, tied with Shayna Baszler). He also holds the record for having four eliminations in a single Survivor Series elimination match.</p><p>When he made his main roster debut in 2015, Strowman quickly earned a reputation as a member of The Wyatt Family's evil horde by donning a black sheep mask and establishing his authority through raw strength. Strowman has been presented as an unstoppable force during his time in the WWE, earning him the nickname "The Monster Among Men." His reappearance in 2022 only served to reinforce his status as "The Monster of all Monsters," underscoring his unrivaled presence in the squared circle.</p><p>Braun Strowman, real name Adam Joseph Scherr, has made a name for himself as a powerful competitor in the WWE..</p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire Braun Strowman (Adam Scherr) for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire Braun Strowman (Adam Scherr) or research availability and pricing for booking Braun Strowman (Adam Scherr) to speak at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire Braun Strowman (Adam Scherr) as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking Braun Strowman (Adam Scherr) to speak.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Braun Strowman (Adam Scherr) in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming.
