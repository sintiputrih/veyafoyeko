In both sports, he had a brief but impressive career.</strong></p><p>He played for the Denver Broncos of the NFL and the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the CFL. Additionally, he was known for being able to will himself to vomit, earning him the nickname Puke.</p><p>Sadly, the former NFL athlete and WWE wrestler has passed away. The WWE revealed Drozdov’s passing on Friday and remembered him as a formidable opponent.</p><p>In a statement sent by his family, Darren was said to have died naturally.</p><p>While numerous concerns surround his personal and professional life, a lot of people are also curious about his wealth and salary before his away. This is what we do know.</p><h2>Craig Drozdov Net Worth, Career, and Achievements Prior to Death</h2><p>According to some web sources, Darren Drozdov’s net worth ranges from $1.2 million to $12 million.</p><p>No formal media outlets, nevertheless, have released specific information on the essayist’s fortune. As a result, the amounts listed above might not be correct or current.</p><p>Although his wages as a football player and wrestler are unknown, his contract, success, and endorsements indicate that he must have made a large salary.</p><p>Between 1993 and 1996, Darren played three seasons in the NFL as a professional. He was a member of the Denver Broncos, Philadelphia Eagles, and New York Jets. NFL players made an average annual pay of between 600K and 700K from the start through the middle of 1990.</p><p>In the late 1990s, Darren ended his football career and started a career in wrestling.</p><p>Sportskeeda estimates that the lowest WWE wrestler wage is $250,000 and the highest is $12,000,000. However, the deceased athlete competed for WWE in the late 1990s. He had to have compensated well even at that time.</p><p>The late athlete must have made a decent living from his work as a WWE pundit and writer, too. It’s possible that Drozdov’s career earnings were more or lower than these averages.</p><h2>Professional Career of Darren Drozdov Examined</h2><p>As indicated before, Darren Drozdov had a brief but impressive career as both a professional wrestler and an American football player.</p><p>The New Jersey native was a defensive tackle for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the CFL and the Denver Broncos of the NFL. The deceased athlete was given the nickname Puke when he vomited on television and became famous for it.</p><p>Later, he joined the World Wrestling Federation, competing under the ring names Droz or Puke.</p><p>When Darren was a member of the Legion of Doom stable, he engaged in combat with wrestlers like D’Lo Brown, The Godfather, and The Headbanger.</p><p>Sadly, a horrible accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down ended his wrestling career.</p><p>When D’Lo Brown used a powerbomb on the skillful wrestler on October 5, 1999, during the recording of WWF SmackDown!, he fell on his head and fractured two vertebrae in his neck. TV never aired the episode.</p><p>Darren kept a good outlook and carried on writing, essaying, and writing columns for WWF despite his injuries. His arms and upper body started to move again as well.</p><p>Darren Drozdov is remembered as a brave and motivational individual who personified the spirit of tenacity and resolve in the face of difficulty.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
