The relatable track tells a story about a girl who wants to escape a relationship that she knows is toxic. While her heart and soul remains planted/uneasy in the unhealthy relationship, she struggles to find a way out, as her significant other is fighting to keep the romance alive.</p><p>The emotional lyrics co-written by <a href=#><strong>Sam Ellis</strong></a>, <strong><a href=#>Ben Caver</a></strong>, and <strong>Sarah Haze</strong> and produced by <strong>Dave Thomson</strong> and <strong>Brad Hill</strong> (<a href=#><strong>Maren Morris</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Brothers Osborne</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Brett Young</strong></a>) will take you on a roller coaster ride.</p><p>“You won’t stay, but won’t walk away, just give me a chance to forget your name/ saying ‘don’t want more,’ but I’m at your door, I don’t want to fight this war / Don’t lock up my love, baby, just let me go/ Holding my heart hostage, now let me go,” the artist sings in the chorus.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-94403"><img decoding=async data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HOSTAGE-Tyra-artwork-1024x1024.jpeg alt width=662 height=662 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Madison is not just a regular country-pop artist scratching the surface of love. The musician dives deep and reveals the internal conflict several individuals face when struggling with a sour relationship. The artist hopes the track strikes a chord with anyone who believes they lost their self-worth while in love and makes them realize it’s time to find themselves again.</p><p>Keep reading for our full Q&A with Tyra, and let us know if you included her new single “<strong><a href=#>Hostage</a></strong>” to your playlist by leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sending us a tweet at <strong>@<a href=#>CS_Country</a></strong>.</p><p>You can keep up with Kelsey by giving her a follow on <a href=#>Instagram</a> + <a href=#>Facebook</a> + <a href=#>Spotify.</a></p><p><strong>Celeb Secrets Country: How did you get into country music?</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tyra Madison:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;“I grew up on bluegrass music. My papaw played the harmonica and my uncle played the guitar, which gave me my love for music. In between, I found a passion for country music – I’ve always appreciated and loved how honest it is. Also, being from Kentucky, you grow up on country music. It’s truly in my blood.”</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>CSC: Which musicians do you turn to for inspiration?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tyra Madison:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;“I look up to <a href=#><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Maren Morris</strong></a>. They both influence me and my music, in totally different ways. I admire Maren for her songwriting… And we all know Carrie can perform and has a powerful voice, but to me she also epitomizes what it means to be a kind, gracious artist.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: When did you start creating music on TikTok?</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TM:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;“I started truly taking TikTok seriously (meaning posting twice a day) in early January, so not too long!

To be honest, the pandemic had put me in a big funk. I couldn’t perform live anywhere (which is my favorite part of what I do), I couldn’t write with people face-to-face so I decided to turn my attention to social media – and it’s worked out pretty well so far.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: Could you tell us the inspiration behind your hit single “Right Girl Wrong Time?”</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TM:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;“My friend in college had been dating a guy since high school. When they both went their separate ways and attended different colleges, their relationship got rocky. He chose the college party life over her. I could tell this hurt her, and when you’re a close friend to someone, you feel what they feel. I was so inspired writing “Right Girl Wrong Time” that me and my co-writer friend, Regan Rosseau, knocked the song out in 2 hours.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HOSTAGE-Tyra-artwork-1024x1024.jpeg><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>CSC: What was going through your head when you jumped from 15K to 150K followers on TikTok for your song “Right Girl Wrong Time”?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TM:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;“Surreal” is the only word I could use to describe it. It made me so emotional that it was my own song, one that I’d put so much work into, that really made people connect on a deeper level on TikTok.

You know you deserve better than the relationship, but you have an emotional attachment to this person that keeps you hanging on. It’s a heart vs. head situation.”</p><p><strong>CSC: What can fans expect from this new single?</strong></p><p><strong>TM:</strong> “Fans can expect a good beat and a great message. I hope it helps them realize their worth, more than anything.”</p><p><strong>CSC: How is the release of “Hostage” different from any other release you have done in the past?</strong></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TM:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;“This time is the first time I feel like I have built-in fans – like there’s a group of people that will follow me and stream my music because they like me as an artist.

In high school, I performed at over 500 birthday parties. As for “Hostage,” it caught mine and my mom’s ear immediately when we first heard it. Not only are the lyrics solid, but the beat and synth reminded us of Coldplay. The general feel of “Hostage” seemed 80’s-inspired, which is what my mom and I used to listen to growing up.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FEnKmerKOYvLa606uwZ5ufonxzfJFqZmlqX2WGcK%2FOrqWtqqlivbC8jJqpraGjqXq1xdGaZKaZlJ7AsLqMqKeepqNiwrF5wJumrqxdnbKzecGinmaaopqurHnOp2StoZupvKx5zZ6uZquZo7StsYyer5ykpai2t7GO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcountry-pop-artist-tyra-madison-opens-up-about-her-big-break-on-tiktok-new-single-exclusive.html&text=&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcountry-pop-artist-tyra-madison-opens-up-about-her-big-break-on-tiktok-new-single-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcountry-pop-artist-tyra-madison-opens-up-about-her-big-break-on-tiktok-new-single-exclusive.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcountry-pop-artist-tyra-madison-opens-up-about-her-big-break-on-tiktok-new-single-exclusive.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcountry-pop-artist-tyra-madison-opens-up-about-her-big-break-on-tiktok-new-single-exclusive.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcountry-pop-artist-tyra-madison-opens-up-about-her-big-break-on-tiktok-new-single-exclusive.html&description=" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bill-cosby-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-95986-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bill Cosby Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-is-riverdale-filmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Riverdale Filmed? - Peerspace">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
