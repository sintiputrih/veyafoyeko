This might have been the biggest shocker on Thursday. His resume boasts over 1500 matches and includes 685 wins in WWE and 38 PPV wins. He was a 2x World Heavyweight Champion, 1x NXT Champion, 6x Intercontinental Champion, 2x US Champion, and a 4x Tag Champion.</p><p>It was a nearly two-decade career with WWE, and he will go down as one of the best in-ring workers of this generation. To some, he was the "next Shawn Michaels". He seemed destined to be among the top guys in WWE and was a fan favorite, win or lose, could have been featured anywhere on the card and have been believable.</p><h2 id=shelton-benjamin-was-among-the-greats-from-ohio-valley-wrestling>Shelton Benjamin Was Among the Greats From Ohio Valley Wrestling</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-for-this-term-2017-2023>WWE Tenure For This Term: 2017-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>48</p></td><td><p>United States Champion, Intercontinental Champion, Raw Tag Team Champion</p></td><td><p>Vs.

He was a 3x Intercontinental Champion, 1x US Champion, 3x 24/7 Champion, 3x Tag Champion, and most recently, part of the now defunct Hurt Business faction.</p><p>Seen as one of the most gifted athletes in a group of OVW graduates that included Brock Lesnar, John Cena, and Batista, Benjamin had a great career, even if he never reached their levels of stardom. Benjamin confirmed his release on social media shortly after it was announced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elias-finally-quot-drifted-quot-away-from-wwe>Elias Finally "Drifted" Away From WWE</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2014-2023>WWE Tenure: 2014-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>36</p></td><td><p>24/7 Champion</p></td><td><p>Intercontinental #1 Contender Battle Royal, Raw (05/15/23)</p></td></tr></table><p>Known for some time as The Drifter from NXT, Elias became quite popular as a heel and then WWE tried to turn him into a babyface musician, even releasing songs that were put out on iTunes.

A popular wrestler who nevertheless found himself in the news headlines for all the wrong reasons, it appears that WWE had enough of the Original Bro and released him from his contract.</p><p>The reason as to why hasn't been confirmed yet, with theories ranging from UFC honcho Dana White's previous beef with the former MMA fighter to WWE simply not wanting to deal with Riddle anymore. A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">source told Fightful Select</a> that Riddle had simply "burned through too many chances" with the promotion.
