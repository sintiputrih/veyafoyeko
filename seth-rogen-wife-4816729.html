Growing up, Lauren was always invested in the arts, so much so that she attended Harrison School For the Arts for her high school education. Later, she went on to attend Florida State University for her higher education. There, she attended the College of Motion Picture Arts to pursue her career in the film industry.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>She is an actress, writer, and director. Lauren has appeared in many hit films, sometimes also alongside her husband Seth. Some of the movies they have been in together include, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, 50/50, Observe and Report, and Superbad. On her own, Lauren has also appeared in other movies without <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seth</a> including, Better Off Single and Growing Up And Other Lies.</p><h2>How Long Have Lauren and Seth Been Married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seth-rogen-wife-Lauren-Miller-shutter-embd-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seth</a> and Lauren have been married for over 10 years, as the cute couple tied the knot together in 2011. In October 2020, Seth shared a sweet wedding <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>anniversary post</a> of him and his wife with the caption, “Happy anniversary to us!! I can’t believe I’ve been lucky enough to find the perfect partner to go through life with. After 9 years married and over 15 years together, I love @laurenmillerrogen more every day. Here’s me beating her at video games at our wedding.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The cute couple met back in 2004, while working on the&nbsp;<i>Da Ali G Show</i>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>reported. After knowing each other for seven years, they had an adorable wedding in Sonoma County in Northern California.</p><h2>Do Lauren and Seth Have Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Although Seth and Lauren have been together for over a decade, they have kept their family as a family of two. The couple does not have any children.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In May 2021, Seth opened up about he and his wife’s decision to not have kids on the Howard Stern Show. “She doesn’t want kids,” he said at the time. “She wants kids less than I do.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I don’t know anyone who gets as much happiness out of their kids as we get out of our non-kids,” Seth added. “We’re f–king psyched all the time. We’re lying in bed Saturday morning, smoking weed, watching movies naked. If we had kids, we could not be doing this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seth-rogen-and-wife-lauren-miller-splashnews-embed.jpg><h2>What Have They said About Each Other?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Seth and Lauren have gushed about their relationships with one another on plenty of occasions. The&nbsp;Superbad&nbsp;star showed just how much he cared for early on when sharing a hilarious story about her rejecting him on a birthday date when they started going out. The self-identified “bad dater” revealed that he cried when she said, “no” after he asked her to be his girlfriend in a February appearance on<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Jimmy Kimmel Live! </a>“I was so young. I guess you don’t ask, ‘Will you be my girlfriend?'” he quipped.&nbsp; “I had terrible experiences dating women and I think the women who dated me also did not have the best experiences.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>They’ve also started the organization Hilarity For Charity together, which aims to bring comedy and good causes together. The pair spoke about how helping Lauren care for her mother when she was suffering from Alzheimer’s lead to the idea for the charity in a December 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Washington Post.</a>&nbsp; Seth spoke about how the experience was important to him. “I tried to be as supportive as I could. I mean, we were pretty young when we started dealing with it. We were in our 20s, you know, and it was my first real long-term relationship I’d ever been in,” he said. ” I think it brought us closer, ultimately, and I think it probably forced us to confront many realities that we would have had to confront eventually, you know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Keq6FloqS0prqMsKCfnV1phXKClmtwaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fseth-rogen-wife-4816729.html&text=Meet%20Lauren%20Miller%20Rogen%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fseth-rogen-wife-4816729.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fseth-rogen-wife-4816729.html&title=Meet%20Lauren%20Miller%20Rogen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fseth-rogen-wife-4816729.html&title=Meet%20Lauren%20Miller%20Rogen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fseth-rogen-wife-4816729.html&title=Meet%20Lauren%20Miller%20Rogen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fseth-rogen-wife-4816729.html&description=Meet%20Lauren%20Miller%20Rogen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pennsylvania-state-police-trooper-troop-g-killed-shootout-suspect-dead-jacques-rougeau-brandon-stine-second-trooper-critical-condition-hershey-medical-police-barracks-patrol-cars-thompsontown-mifflintown-juniata-county-06-19-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pennsylvania state trooper killed with high-caliber rifle in shootout identified">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meet-corey-conners-parents-mike-and-janet-conners-where-are-they-from-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Corey Conners Parents Mike And Janet Conners- Where Are They From?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
