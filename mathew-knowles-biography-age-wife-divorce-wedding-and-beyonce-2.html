In the film version of Lemonade, Bey also recites several powerful monologues written by Somali-British poet Warsan Shire. At least one of those lines, however, seems less related to Jay Z and more relevant to someone else who shares a complicated past with Beyoncé:</p><p>“You remind me of my father, a magician. Able to exist in two places at once. In the tradition of men in my blood, you come home at 3 a.m. and lie to me. What are you hiding?”</p><p>It’s no secret that Beyoncé’s father, Mathew Knowles, had more than one public foray into infidelity, which led to his divorce from his wife Tina Knowles (now remarried to Richard Lawson). Is Beyoncé drawing a parallel from her mother’s former marriage to her own? It’s possible, especially considering author J. Randy Taraborrelli’s unauthorized biography Becoming Beyoncé, which highlighted many rumored tumultuous incidents between Mathew and his family. Below, Cosmopolitan.com examines the professional relationship between Beyoncé and Mathew, from Girls Tyme all the way up through Lemonade.</p><p><strong>Sept. 4, 1981:</strong> Beyoncé Giselle Knowles enters the world at Houston’s Park Plaza Hospital. By the time she’s 2 months old, Mathew and Tina have briefly split; the reason is unclear, but Mathew returned shortly thereafter.</p><p><strong>1988:</strong> Beyoncé wins the Baby Junior Award at the Sammy Davis Jr.-honoring Sammy Awards. A year later, she would be the guest performer at the ceremony. Mathew begins to take interest in his daughter’s potential career in entertainment.</p><p><strong>1989:</strong> Denise Seals and Deborah Laday discover Beyoncé at an audition at the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center. They approach Mathew and Tina about starting a girl group, naming them Girls Tyme, and including Beyoncé.</p><p><strong>June 1990:</strong> Beyoncé and Girls Tyme have their first performance at Texas’ Prairie View A&M University, when Beyoncé is 8 years old.</p><p><strong>August 1992:</strong> With Beyoncé seemingly the future star of her group, Mathew makes the move to co-manage Girls Tyme (later called The Dolls and then Destiny’s Child), receiving half of the going managerial rate. His personal vision for the group, combined with his demanding demeanor, cause rumors that he’s a difficult person to work with. Later, he moved group rehearsals to his home, and trained the girls (including his own daughter and Kelly Rowland) like they were in singing bootcamp. He would, however, focus on Beyoncé. The two would have professional ups and downs, especially when a singer named Ashley Davis left Girls Tyme. According to Taraborrelli, Beyoncé wanted to talk things out with her former groupmate, but Mathew wouldn’t allow it.</p><p><strong>Fall 1995:</strong> After enduring multiple financial pitfalls, the Knowles family separates and later sells Beyoncé’s childhood home. The split took its toll on Beyoncé, who was formerly closer to her father and in his absence developed a stronger bond with her mother (Mathew would eventually return home again). Professionally, Mathew would demand more money from his managerial contract with Destiny’s Child, claiming that his pay didn’t match his level of work. His label Music World Entertainment was formed from this deal.</p><p><strong>December 1995:</strong> Destiny’s Child signs a seven-album deal with Columbia/Sony, with Mathew taking the largest managerial percentage while handling all of the expenses.</p><p><strong>January 2000:</strong> After much back-and-forth in dealing with Mathew Knowles, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett leave Destiny’s Child.</p><p><strong>March 2000:</strong> LaTavia and LeToya file a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé, and Kelly Rowland, with Mathew being the primary target. They later told MTV their issues were with poor management and not their groupmates.</p><p><strong>July 2000:</strong> The final lineup of Destiny’s Child includes Beyoncé, Kelly, and Michelle Williams.</p><p><strong>January 2002:</strong> Sons of the late Andretta Tillman — who was integral in the success of Destiny’s Child — sue Mathew, Beyoncé, and Kelly for millions. Accusations include Andretta’s estate never being properly compensated for Destiny’s Child’s success, and also Mathew’s sex and drug addictions causing him to make poor financial decisions. (Beyoncé was rumored to have not known that the Tillman estate did not receive adequate payment.) From the $35 million lawsuit, the two Tillman sons cleared $1.25 million total.</p><p><strong>June 2003:</strong> Beyoncé releases her first solo album, Dangerously In Love. Mathew is credited as an executive producer. The album closes with the song “Daddy,” in which Beyoncé sings lines like, “I want my unborn son to be like my daddy / I want my husband to be like my daddy / There is no one else like my daddy / And I thank you for loving me.”</p><p><strong>2004:</strong> Beyoncé seals her fate as a solo star (while still in Destiny’s Child) with a strong business alliance with Mathew Knowles. Mathew would receive executive producer credits on both Destiny’s Child and Beyoncé projects.</p><p><strong>November 2004:</strong> Destiny’s Child releases their final album, Destiny Fulfilled.</p><p><strong>August 2006:</strong> After rumors spread that “Ring the Alarm” is about Rihanna, Mathew releases a statement implying that all the drama is just an attempt to sabotage B’Day.</p><p><strong>November 2008:</strong> After having less input on B’Day, Mathew Knowles returns for I Am…Sasha Fierce, Beyoncé’s third solo album.</p><p><strong>March 2009:</strong> Beyoncé embarks on the “I Am…” tour, as Mathew’s input lessens during his relationship with Alexsandra Wright, who is expecting a child.</p><p><strong>October 2009:</strong> Alexsandra files a paternity suit against Mathew. In March 2010, a DNA test confirms that he is the father of the child.</p><p><strong>November 2009:</strong> Tina files from divorce from Mathew. “The decision to end our marriage is an amicable one,” the couple say in a statement to the Associated Press. “We remain friends, parents, and business partners. If anyone is expecting an ugly messy fight, they will be sadly disappointed.”</p><p><strong>October 2010:</strong> After Live Nation advises Beyoncé that her father is potentially stealing money from her “I Am…” tour, Beyoncé orders an audit through law firm Reed Smith LLP.</p><p><strong>March 2011:</strong> Beyoncé announces that she’s officially severing professional ties to her father. In December, Tina’s divorce from Mathew is finalized.</p><p><strong>June 2011:</strong> Beyoncé releases 4, her first album without professional input from Mathew.</p><p><strong>July 2011:</strong> Mathew Knowles files a lawsuit against Live Nation, stating they falsely accused him of stealing from his daughter. In October, the court rules in favor of Live Nation.</p><p><strong>January 2012:</strong> Beyoncé and her father mend fences after her daughter Blue Ivy is born. MediaTakeout refers to their reunion as “tearful.”</p><p><strong>February 2013:</strong> In a candid interview with Oprah, Beyoncé explains her struggles with her father acknowledging her as an adult in the past, making decisions for her even though she was 18. She also discusses her relationship with him in the HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream, which airs the same night.</p><p><strong>March 2013:</strong> Mathew alleges to London’s The Sun that Beyoncé didn’t let him go — they “let each other go.”</p><p><strong>July 2013:</strong> TMZ reports that both Beyoncé and Solange are no-shows for Mathew’s wedding to Gena Avery.</p><p><strong>July 2014:</strong> TaQoya Branscomb sues Mathew for paternity, claiming that he fathered a child with her in 2010. In September, a DNA test confirms that he is the father.</p><p><strong>August 2014:</strong> Mathew says that the constantly swirling Beyoncé and Jay divorce rumors are “a Jedi mind trick” designed to sell tickets for the “On the Run” tour.</p><p><strong>November 2014:</strong> Beyoncé releases “Ring Off,” the lyrics of which address infidelity in a marriage. The song begins, “Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights / When you sit and you think about father / Or how you tried to be the perfect wife.”</p><p><strong>April 2015:</strong> Beyoncé and Solange attend Tina’s wedding to Richard Lawson.</p><p><strong>September 2015:</strong> Mathew tells the Huffington Post that he still manages Destiny’s Child and says he has a “few Destiny’s Child projects” in the works, including a movie or TV show. He also says he’s “extremely hopeful” for a reunion tour.</p><p><strong>October 2015:</strong> In an interview with Power 105.1, Mathew claims Beyoncé is the same age as P!nk, meaning she’s lied about her age (P!nk was born in 1979).</p><p><strong>February 2016:</strong> In an interview with That Grape Juice, Mathew discusses his daughter’s business acumen after severing professional ties with him: “[Beyoncé] had to make some mistakes,” he says, “and mistakes were made in my opinion — but she’s learned from them. And I think she’s done an incredible job.”</p><p><strong>April 2016:</strong> Beyoncé releases Lemonade, which includes a song called “Daddy Lessons” with the lyrics, “My daddy warned me about men like you / He said, ‘Baby girl, he’s playing you.’” This leads to speculation that the infidelity references on the album are not entirely about Jay Z. Following the release of the album, Mathew responds to rumors that Beyoncé targeted him on Lemonade: “I can only speculate like everyone else. And I think the genius in this body of work that Beyoncé has done is she has us all speculating and she has us all letting our minds expand on her words and the expansion of them.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mathew-knowles-book></span>Mathew Knowles Book<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He has authored books like:</p><ul><li>Racism: From The Eyes Of A Child it was published in 2017.</li><li>The Dna of Achievers: 10 Traits of Highly Successful Professionals it was published in 2015.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mathew-knowles-wedding-mathew-knowles-married></span>Mathew Knowles Wedding |&nbsp;Mathew Knowles Married<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mathew-knowles-facebook></span>Mathew Knowles Facebook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=-mathew-knowles-twitter></span>&nbsp;Mathew Knowles Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by MathewKnowles</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mathew-knowles-instagram></span>Mathew Knowles Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq-6GELBtX3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><h1 style=text-align:center>Mathew Knowles News</h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mathew-knowles-launches-latest-book-in-cape-town></span>Mathew Knowles launches latest book in Cape Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=updated-on-21-october-2018></span>Updated on: 21 October 2018.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>American music industry legend and author Mathew Knowles was in Cape Town to launch his latest book this week in addition to shooting a documentary.</p><p>Knowles, the father of singing superstar Beyoncé who recently reunited with his daughter on her On the Runway II concert tour, launched his latest book, Emancipation Of Slaves Through Music, at the UCT Graduate School of Business on Friday.</p><p>“There’s a misconception among a lot of Americans that as the slaves were African they were just one big tribe and knew how to communicate to each other and yet 30% of them were Muslim and from different tribes,” Knowles said.</p><p>“It took them about two years to get to America by those ships and it was through knocking on the walls, moaning and crying, and clinking the chains that they began to communicate.”</p><p>Through those sounds, voices and rhythm were added to create music – a common language and form of communication.</p><p>“Music became a part of life – the evolution of music – from what were sorrow songs which became spiritual songs and later gospel, blues in Mississippi, R&B – that evolution started with slave ships,” Knowles said.</p><p>Not only does American music owe most of its origin to slave ships, but rap music was apparently started by a universal Zulu nation in New York, he added.</p><p>During his trip to South Africa, Knowles also hosted the African Leaders4Change Awards in Pretoria, appeared as a guest on ‘Idols’ and said his team would be shooting a documentary on the continent.</p><p>The issue of race or colourism is still a major one in the US, he added, especially in the music industry.</p><p>His second book, Racism Through The Eyes Of A Child, explored the subject and how it affected him while growing up.</p><p>A fourth book is on the cards.</p><p>“My next book was to be Destiny’s Child – the untold story. But after a three-day stay here I have changed my mind. The book will be about: Am I black or am I African-American because I am not sure – I want to research this.</p><p>“I think the consensus from Africans is that in America we aren’t African Americans, but we are black. But I want to do research on who first created this name and who used it. I also want to get a sense from people around the world on how they conceive us,” Knowles said.</p><p>Having worked with great artists in America as a record label owner and talent manager including his daughters Beyoncé and Solange and now Nigerian violinist and singer, Demola, he believed that Afro beats would take American music by storm.</p><p>“The impact of Afro-pop/Afro beats will be the biggest next thing in music in America,” he said.</p><p><strong>Adopted from: www.iol.co.za</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRqbWmw4ykpaivnJrAbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5ksKGWmnqltdWoqZydXayypbDIp55mmZ6ZeqOx2KilnJ1dZ3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmathew-knowles-biography-age-wife-divorce-wedding-and-beyonce-2.html&text=Mathew%20Knowles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Wedding%20and%20Beyonce&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmathew-knowles-biography-age-wife-divorce-wedding-and-beyonce-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmathew-knowles-biography-age-wife-divorce-wedding-and-beyonce-2.html&title=Mathew%20Knowles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Wedding%20and%20Beyonce" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmathew-knowles-biography-age-wife-divorce-wedding-and-beyonce-2.html&title=Mathew%20Knowles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Wedding%20and%20Beyonce" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmathew-knowles-biography-age-wife-divorce-wedding-and-beyonce-2.html&title=Mathew%20Knowles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Wedding%20and%20Beyonce" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmathew-knowles-biography-age-wife-divorce-wedding-and-beyonce-2.html&description=Mathew%20Knowles%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Wedding%20and%20Beyonce" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-before-the-90-days-cast-this-week-mar-7.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Before The 90 Days Cast This Week (Mar 7)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kyle-fox-pulls-out-rangers-29469736.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kyle Fox ends Rangers takeover bid after Ibrox shareholders give proposal the short shrift">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
