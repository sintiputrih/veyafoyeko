That loss has felt particularly intense as Hoffman’s last remaining films have trickled out; alas, Hoffman does not have a Tupac-like deluge of unreleased posthumous material left (nor did directors possess the shamelessness to <a href=#>digitally enhance</a> what was left behind). Accordingly, today’s release of <a href=#><i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2</i></a><i> — </i>the final film Hoffman made — gives a world that never stopped mourning Hoffman another opportunity to celebrate one of the greatest actors of all time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-2-0-2@published data-word-count=109>With that in mind, we figured this would be a good time to delve deep into Hoffman’s filmography to determine what art of Hoffman’s is objectively, definitively better than his other art. In making our selection, we considered both the quality of the film as well as Hoffman’s performance. Though we strived to be as complete as possible, we were not able to see <i>Mockingjay Part 2 </i>ahead of this article, nor were we able to track down two of his most obscure early films, <i>Szuler </i>and <i>Joey Breaker,</i> left behind in VHS format<i>. </i>We still, however, had an <i>awful </i>lot to sift through, much of it awfully good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-3-0-0@published data-word-count=178><b>51. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=DgSZbc>Patch Adams</a> </i>(1998)</b><i><br>Patch Adams </i>doesn’t just belong on the bottom of a ranked list of films by a great actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman; it’d belong on the bottom of any ranked list, regardless of context. The sole collaboration between Robin Williams and Hoffman was an enormous commercial hit that has been appropriately pilloried as the unwatchable nadir of Williams’s tendency toward shameless schmaltz. Not even Hoffman’s ornery performance as an early roommate of the good doctor, seemingly the only person not utterly charmed by the protagonist’s zany cult of personality, can redeem this, especially since his character disappears for a long stint, then returns as just another captivated fan of the titular wisecracking yet tender-hearted medical professional. The great thing about Hoffman’s career is that <i>Patch Adams </i>is a glaring anomaly in a life otherwise fiercely devoted to pursuing truthful roles and pushing himself to the brink of his extraordinary abilities. The tragic thing about Robin Williams’s intermittently brilliant but far more checkered career is that <i>Patch Adams </i>was the rule rather than the exception.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-4-0-0@published data-word-count=121><b>50. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=AVy9tS>Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole</a> </i>(1991)</b><br>Hoffman made his film debut in 1991’s <i>Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole, </i>a black-and-white crime opus with unfortunate aspirations to be <i>Citizen Kane </i>on a budget that, unfortunately, lives up to the groaning pretension of its title. Playing a scuzzy pool-hall low-life named Klutch, Hoffman cackles maniacally for no discernible reason in a blink-and-you-miss-it role that is the film’s sole claim to fame. Hoffman’s appearance is defined by his wardrobe more than his dialogue. When you’re introduced rocking a sleeveless T-shirt, studded, fingerless motorcycle gloves, and a sweet-ass bandanna, there’s nowhere to go but up — though few could have imagined then the heights to which Hoffman’s career would soar.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-5-0-0@published data-word-count=132><b>49.<i> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=yjRNvL>Montana</a> </i>(1998)</b><br>In the aftermath of the culture-wide explosion of Tarantino mania in the mid 1990s, the fringes of bloody American genre-movies were filled with knockoffs nakedly trying to recapture Quentin’s bleakly funny, hyperbolically macho brand of tough-guy cinema. None of them were as good as Tarantino but many of them were just as bad as 1998’s <i>Montana, </i>a muddled crime movie that wastes a terrific cast (Hoffman, Stanley Tucci, Robbie Coltrane, John Ritter, Mark Boone Junior) on a rancid, self-infatuated screenplay about the machinations among a group of scuzzy criminals. In one of his most negligible performances, Hoffman plays oily money man Duncan, who is craftier than the short-tempered hoods in his circle, but, as was often the case with Hoffman’s scheming characters, not quite as crafty as he imagines.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-6-0-0@published data-word-count=170><b>48. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=2I1jjS>Flawless</a> </i>(1999)</b><br>Robert De Niro.

The third directed <i>Batman & Robin. </i>Unfortunately, the Joel Schumacher factor far outweighs the pairing of De Niro and Hoffman in the mismatched buddy drama <i>Flawless,</i> a movie whose premise (ornery homophobe takes voice lessons with a soulful drag queen, life lessons ensue) sounds like it has the potential to be a compelling, 1970s-style exploration of life on the fringes and the strange bedfellows it creates. Instead, the film plays more like a lumbering TV movie that takes forever to clumsily deliver the message that drag queens are people, too, even if it takes close-minded bigots like De Niro’s character some time to accept that incontrovertible fact. Hoffman gives the role of a melancholy drag queen and vocal coach his all, but fails to elevate the proceedings. Seldom, if ever, has Hoffman done more acting in the service of an innately doomed project.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-7-0-0@published data-word-count=136><b>47. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=t9pSFA>The Party’s Over</a> </i>(2001)</b><br>Who was Philip Seymour Hoffman? Fans came to feel like they knew him through his art, but for a man who made such a profound impression on the world of film, precious little was known about him as a person. That’s part of what makes the political documentary <i>The Party’s Over </i>so oddly revealing. A follow-up to 1993’s <i>The Last Party,</i> a similar political documentary made by Robert Downey Jr. (an actor whose personal life audiences know, if anything, <i>far </i>too much about), <i>The Party’s Over </i>is interesting today less for the nonexistent insight it provides into the American political process than for the insight it provides into Hoffman, who emerges as a sweet, passionate, and curious man, and, alas, just about the last person qualified to host a political documentary.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-8-0-0@published data-word-count=129><b>46. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=XjJytD>Twister</a> </i>(1996)</b><br>Hoffman’s supporting turn as a storm-chasing weather freak in the enormously popular early-CGI extravaganza <i>Twister </i>hints at an alternative future for the actor in which he wouldn’t be known as a heavyweight thespian revered by the greatest talents of the day, but rather a red-headed goofball screwing around affably on the margins of major motion pictures. Thankfully, that was not to be, and <i>Twister, </i>like <i>Along Came Polly, </i>stands as an outlier in this very serious man’s very serious (but often hilarious) career. <i>Along Came Polly </i>at least has the benefit of a great, humorous performance by Hoffman, whereas the nicest thing that can be said about Hoffman here is that at least he’s not boring. Tacky, silly, and broad? Sure. But boring, he is not.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-9-0-0@published data-word-count=120><b>45. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=YJJY06>Scent of a Woman</a> </i>(1992)</b><br>It’s faint praise to argue that Hoffman’s performance as an oily-prep school creep who tries to manipulate Chris O’Donnell’s scholarship twerp in <i>Scent of a Woman </i>is the element of the film that holds up best today, because other than the film’s cinematography, it’s the only part of the film that doesn’t feel glaringly, egregious false. This includes Al Pacino’s obnoxious performance as a nightmarish sentient shout of a man dead set on getting the actor playing him an undeserved Academy Award. Though Pacino and O’Donnell are supposed to be the heroes (or anti-heroes at least) of the film, they’re so insufferable that they inspire sympathy for Hoffman’s guileful if overmatched antagonist by default.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-10-0-0@published data-word-count=100><b>44. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=q5oauv>The Getaway</a> </i>(1994)</b><br>As a young film actor, Hoffman paid his dues with plenty of lowlife roles that exploited the actor’s sweaty intensity and bruising physicality but otherwise proved equally untaxing and unrewarding. That’s the kind of role Hoffman played in Roger Donaldson’s adaptation of Jim Thompson’s <i>The Getaway, </i>which had previously been adapted by Sam Peckinpah in a memorably reprehensible exploration of the seedy depths of human depravity. Hoffman fits right into his scuzzy environments, but thankfully his days of adding some color and bite to gruff, working-class bit roles was drawing to a close by the mid-’90s.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-11-0-0@published data-word-count=106><b>43. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=dLQKVn>Along Came Polly</a> </i>(2004)</b><br>Hoffman’s participation in the <i>Mission Impossible </i>and <i>Hunger Games </i>franchises illustrates that he was not entirely averse to picking up a nice paycheck in a big commercial movie that might play somewhere outside art houses, but the actor’s career is remarkably slim on movies clearly made for commercial reasons. That’s part of what makes Hoffman’s performance as a hilariously overconfident former child star in <i>Along Came Polly </i>so refreshing. Hoffman proves himself a surprisingly deft and confident physical comedian, but his wonderfully loose and goofy performance only elevates this pandering, formulaic Jennifer Aniston–Ben Stiller rom-com to the level of affable mediocrity.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-12-0-0@published data-word-count=104><b>42.<i> </i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=GnBjnC><i>Pirate Radio, </i>aka<i> The Boat That Rocked</i></a><i> </i>(2009)<br></b>It’s tempting to imagine what Lester Bangs, that preeminent martyr of musical good taste and journalistic integrity, whom Hoffman played so unforgettably in <i>Almost Famous, </i>would have made of the cheap, easy rock and roll and 1960s nostalgia of Richard Curtis’s <i>Pirate Radio. </i>Chances are good he’d find the film’s cartoonish deification of ‘60s rock rebellion self-aggrandizing, bland, and mediocre, even if Hoffman’s performance as “the Count,” an American DJ flying the flag for good, old rock and roll on a British pirate radio station, gives this sentimental nonsense what little genuine passion it possesses.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-13-0-0@published data-word-count=118><b>41.<i> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=mdFJpH>God’s Pocket</a> </i>(2014)</b><br>There is a certain kind of grim, intentionally modest art film that needs the peculiar oxygen and generosity of spirit found at film festivals (particularly Sundance) in order to live, and dies an unmourned death in the real world. One such film is <i>God’s Pocket, </i>the directorial debut from <i>Mad Men</i> silver fox John Slattery, which Hoffman produced as well as co-starred in as a small-time neighborhood criminal terrified of losing what little he has. It’s a grungy adaptation of a Pete Dexter novel set in the early days of the Reagan era, a well-acted and grim exercise in grubby miserablism that never quite justifies its existence, despite the quality of the people involved.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-14-0-0@published data-word-count=110><b>40. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=qoGwon>Money for Nothing</a> </i>(1993)</b><br>Even when Hoffman’s early films weren’t remarkable, their casts almost always were. It’s difficult to envision a major motion picture more minor than <i>Money for Nothing, </i>a low-budget shrug of a movie in the low-stakes, low-energy, low-yield Touchstone mode about a real-life nobody who finds over a million dollars and then must wrestle with the ramifications of his discovery. Playing a small-timer who’s sharper than his lummoxlike exterior would suggest, Hoffman is joined by a preposterously overqualified supporting cast that includes Michael Madsen, Debi Mazar, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, and Maury Chaykin, all of whom were destined for bigger and better films.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-15-0-0@published data-word-count=111><b>39.<i> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=3vyG7D>Leap of Faith</a> </i>(1992)</b><i><br>Leap of Faith </i>once again finds a young, attention-hungry Hoffman in a small but memorable supporting role as a small-time criminal, but this time around the criminal enterprise he’s involved in is of an unusual variety. In this promising but underwhelming comedy-drama, Hoffman plays part of a roving band of charlatans and con artists who fleece the faithful at the behest of a sham healer and evangelist played by Steve Martin. The sections of the film devoted to Hoffman and his partners in crime are colorful and engaging, but the central dynamic is a non-starter, the dramatic elements of the film only dragging it down further.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-16-0-0@published data-word-count=116><b>38.<i> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=W5TWgD>A Late Quartet</a> </i>(2012)</b><br>How do you make the once-in-a-lifetime teaming of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Christopher Walken a non-event? Get them to star in a film called <i>A Late Quartet, </i>whose PBS-pledge-drive-ready title all too accurately captures the tone and tenor of the film: refrained, highbrow, and respectably, artfully boring. Essentially, the material does not rise to the level of the actors in the film. Of the respected thespians playing the titular quartet of musicians wrestling with decades of resentment, Hoffman has the most to work with, however. His character’s raw yearning for his day in the sun after an endless expanse of patiently waiting is all that breaks through the film’s tasteful tedium.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-17-0-0@published data-word-count=97><b>37. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=fg9Qzy>When a Man Loves a Woman</a> </i>(1994)</b><br>Addiction was a theme in Hoffman’s career dating back to his pre-stardom days. Before <i>Owning Mahony, </i>before<i> The Devil Knows You’re Dead </i>and <i>Love Liza, </i>Hoffman co-starred in this drama as a recovering alcoholic whose bond with a depressed wife (Meg Ryan) threatens her husband (Andy Garcia).

Anderson needed an actor who could match the presence of a titan of the craft like Jason Robards in his final role, and was eminently justified in thinking Hoffman was an actor of that caliber. It’s tough to watch their scenes together now that they’re both gone, but as with so much of Hoffman’s brutally intense filmography, it was pretty tough to watch scenes in that high of an emotional register even at the time of <i>Magnolia</i>’s release.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-48-0-0@published data-word-count=166><b>8. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=KCk7Df>The Talented Mr. Ripley</a> </i>(1999)</b><br>Hoffman spent much of his film career suffering soulfully in a variety of tragic and tragicomic contexts. He was able to inhabit the complete range of human emotions across many kinds of characters, but he didn’t get to play sexy very often. In Anthony Minghela’s brilliant psychodrama <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley, </i>however, Hoffman exuded brash, cocky sexuality (he’s introduced expressing a desire to fuck every woman he meets) as a debonair continental playboy whose life is all about good food, good music, good clothes, and good sex. He’s a man for whom life is one wild party that begins to come to a close once he encounters the title character (Matt Damon), a sociopathic social-climber who wants what Hoffman and a buddy played by Jude Law have, and is more than willing to kill for it. Of course, Hoffman wasn’t <i>quite </i>as conventionally attractive as Law or Damon, but what he lacked in looks, he made up for in attitude.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-50-0-0@published data-word-count=125><b><i>7. <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=T5nPzn>Owning Mahowny</a> </i></b><b>(2002)</b><br>Addiction has seldom looked as captivatingly mundane as it does in the riveting 2002 Canadian drama <i>Owning Mahowny, </i>which told the stranger-than-fiction story of a sad brown Sears suit of a numbers-cruncher, who orchestrated one of the largest embezzlement schemes in Canadian history in order to cover up his gambling addiction. A tragically mustachioed Hoffman makes for a perversely non-perverse addict, a man whose intentionally dreary exterior purposefully masked a life ruled by an insatiable urge for self-destruction. His performance is appropriately internal, but there are heartbreaking moments throughout when the character’s cultivated poker face gives way to an expression that betrays his psychological unraveling as his secret life gets harder to control and keep separate from his humdrum everyday existence.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-52-0-0@published data-word-count=145><b>6. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=5Ih7py>Synecdoche, New York</a> </i>(2008)</b><br>When it comes to human suffering, Sisyphus had nothing on Caden Cotard, the brilliant and troubled playwright Hoffman portrayed in <i>Synecdoche, New York, </i>Charlie Kaufman’s directorial debut. The film takes the desperately human postmodernism that characterized Kaufman’s scripts for <i>Being John Malkovich </i>and <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind </i>and expands it into an epic exploration of the exquisite misery of human existence. It’s one of the most ambitious comedies of all time, to the point where it feels unfair to reduce it to one genre. <i>Synecdoche, New York </i>isn’t just a film about the biggest things imaginable (art, love, family, mankind’s search for meaning in a random and insane world); it’s a film about <i>everything.</i> The immense gravity Hoffman brings to his role keeps the entire movie from spinning off into the ether, no matter how surreal it becomes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-54-0-0@published data-word-count=166><b>5. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=7vi60A>The 25th Hour</a> </i>(2002)</b><br>In <i>The 25th Hour, </i>Spike Lee’s hyperreal meditation on post-9/11 New York, Hoffman, Barry Pepper, and Edward Norton play childhood friends who have held onto that bond even as adulthood has pulled them in such different directions, it’s doubtful they would be friends if they’d met as adults. The film follows this trio of friends in the uncertain day and night before Norton’s character has to turn himself in for a long prison sentence. Hoffman is cast against type as the most bookish of the trio, a shy teacher with a crush on a 17-year-old student played by Anna Paquin, who shows up unexpectedly during the trio’s night of debauchery in ways that both excite and terrify Hoffman’s character. In <i>The 25th Hour, </i>the city is electric with excitement, and Hoffman’s performance — at once wonderfully life-size yet bursting with unrequited longing — adds to this sense that the city itself is alive, a creature with a will of its own.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-56-0-0@published data-word-count=153><b>4. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=J47hg2>The Big Lebowski</a> </i>(1998)</b><br>In a perfect world, Hoffman would have become a ubiquitous repertory player in the Coen Brothers’ films, joining folks like George Clooney, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro in playing a series of scamps, ne’er-do-wells, and colorful characters. Alas, Hoffman’s corner of the Coen Brothers’ sprawling cinematic universe is a small one, but as with so many of Hoffman’s attention-grabbing turns in seminal films of the 1990s, there is an inverse relationship between his limited time onscreen and the impact he makes. Acting opposite Jeff Bridges in his career-defining role as shaggily heroic 1960s casualty the Dude, Hoffman is exquisitely smarmy and unctuous as the glad-handing flunky of the wheelchair-bound crank known as the Big Lewbowski, whose life ends up overlapping with the Dude’s in hilarious and unexpected ways. Hoffman plays the character as a man so meek, he’d apologize to his own shadow for getting in its way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-58-0-0@published data-word-count=148><b>3.<i> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=x84AAZ>Boogie Nights</a> </i>(1997)</b><br>Hoffman followed up his scene-stealing bit part in <i>Hard Eight </i>with an even more remarkable scene-stealing supporting role in <i>Boogie Nights, </i>P.T. Anderson’s brilliant, empathetic exploration of the bruised hearts and overheated loins of the late 1970s/early 1980s SoCal porn scene. You’d have to go back to <i>American Graffiti </i>or <i>Dazed and Confused </i>to find a movie that gave as many career-making roles to future stars, but even in this esteemed company, Hoffman’s performance as Scotty, a gay crew member with a tragic lack of awareness about which clothes flatter his frame, stands out. With a lesser actor, Scotty could easily have come across as a homophobic caricature of a pathetic guy delusionally in love with someone he can never have (Mark Wahlberg), but Hoffman makes him wonderfully relatable, a sweet man with an impossible crush neither the movie nor Hoffman judge him for.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-60-0-0@published data-word-count=257><b>2.<i> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=tgPb4Z>The Master</a> </i>(2012)</b><br>With his pale skin, striking red hair, and unconventionally compelling looks, Hoffman bears a distinct physical resemblance to L. Ron Hubbard, the controversial author of <i>Battlefield Earth </i>who also apparently unlocked the secrets of the universe and was willing to share them with acolytes of the Church of Scientology for a steep cost. So when Anderson was looking for an actor to play Lancaster Dodd, a larger-than-life author and philosopher overtly based on Hubbard, Hoffman’s casting was a no-brainer. Even someone as brilliant as Anderson at utilizing Hoffman’s gifts might not have realized, however, what explosive chemistry the actor would have with Joaquin Phoenix, who tackles the equally challenging but different role as the raging man-child Dodd takes on as sort of a protégé, surrogate child, and strange alter-ego. More importantly, however, Hoffman had the cult-leader charisma required to play a man so captivating in his magnetism that he was able to convince seemingly intelligent people to abandon their critical faculties and give themselves over to his fantasies of endless personal potential. <i>Almost Famous </i>might have given Hoffman a better role than <i>The Master, </i>but no role was bigger than the majestic con of a man he played here. Paul Thomas Anderson’s collaboration with Hoffman began with a small but significant part in <i>Hard Eight, </i>but the scope of their partnership grew in size until it required the largely anachronistic format of 70mm — used in massive epics throughout the 1950s and 1960s before falling out of favor — to contain its majesty.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-ae9b47ad1b4ddbb297c7ed9ea7d42790-62-0-0@published data-word-count=174><b>1. <i><a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=eqkDOI>Almost Famous</a> </i>(2000)</b><br>Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the big, bleeding heart of <i>Almost Famous, </i>Cameron Crowe’s semiautobiographical comedy about coming of age in the 1970s’ debauched rock-and-roll world. In perhaps his signature role, Hoffman plays legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs as a beacon of compassion disguised as an intimidating grouch, a philosopher in the shabby costume of a slob. Though Hoffman’s role<i> </i>is exceedingly brief, it’s tough to overestimate its importance to the film. Bangs doesn’t just offer crucial mentorship to Crowe’s doe-eyed surrogate at a time when he needs it most. No, the performance transcends the film itself (even a film as beloved as <i>Almost Famous</i>) so that Bangs, through Hoffman — or possibly Hoffman, through Bangs (when an actor and character fuse to this extent, it’s tough to separate them) — is sending out a timeless message of radical self-acceptance to anyone who needs it. In death, as in life, Hoffman belongs to us all, but he belongs to the misfits, outsiders, and oddballs he played so compellingly most of all.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Every Philip Seymour Hoffman Movie, Ranked</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdhZnyxtMiloKllo5rGrrvUq2Shp5abuqK6jJ%2BgpaWjYr%2Biusqem2egpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-films-ranked-html.html&text=Every%20Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Movie%2c%20Ranked%20From%20Worst%20to%20Best&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-films-ranked-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-films-ranked-html.html&title=Every%20Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Movie%2c%20Ranked%20From%20Worst%20to%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-films-ranked-html.html&title=Every%20Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Movie%2c%20Ranked%20From%20Worst%20to%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-films-ranked-html.html&title=Every%20Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Movie%2c%20Ranked%20From%20Worst%20to%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-films-ranked-html.html&description=Every%20Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Movie%2c%20Ranked%20From%20Worst%20to%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-good-is-the-hailey-bieber-erewhon-smoothie-for-you.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Good Is the Hailey Bieber Erewhon Smoothie for You?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./celebrities-with-bangs-best-haircuts-with-fringe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrities With Bangs: Best Haircuts With Fringe">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
