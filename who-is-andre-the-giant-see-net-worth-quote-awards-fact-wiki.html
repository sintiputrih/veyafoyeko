Andre was an actor and professional wrestler, best known to have appeared as part of the World Wrestling Federation. He’s also well-known for being a part of the film “The Princess Bride” and all of his efforts have raised his net worth to where it was prior to his passing. Andre passed away in Paris in 1993.</p><p>How rich was Andre the Giant? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that was at $10 million, mostly earned through his success in wrestling. He is considered one of the most iconic wrestlers of all time, having feuded with other wrestling icons such as Hulk Hogan. He also appeared in films from the 1960s, and all of these efforts ensured his wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=andre-the-giant-net-worth-10-million></span>Andre the Giant Net Worth $10 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Andre started showing signs of gigantism at a young age, having reached the height of 6 feet 3 inches (2m) when he was 12 years old. He was good at school, but dropped out in the eighth grade as he believed that high school education wasn’t necessary for working on a farm, and worked for many years on his father’s farm, including completing an apprenticeship in woodworking. He then worked at a factory that made engines for hay balers.</p><p>When he was 17 years old, a local promoter found interest in Andre’s size, and taught him professional wrestling; while training, he still had to work as a mover during the day to pay for his expenses. Eventually he started wrestling in Paris, gaining considerable recognition locally. He then started travelling around the world, wrestling in Africa, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and in 1970 he became part of the International Wrestling Enterprise in Japan. They called him “Monster Roussimoff” and he became a singles and tag team competitor. He then moved to Montreal and found a large following, before wrestling in such places as Baghdad, before joining the American Wrestling Association (AWA). Eventually, Andre was given the name “Andre the Giant”, and started becoming booked as part of the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) under Vince McMahon, Sr.</p><p>While Andre lost matches outside of the WWF, he was often promoted as a wrestler who didn’t lose any match for 15 years. He had numerous ‘feuds’ while a part of the company, and wrestled for various promotions as well. During his early career, he feuded with other large competitors such as Killer Khan, Big John Studd, and King Kong Bundy. He was considered a “face” in the organization, promoted mostly as a protagonist in storylines. In 1987, Andre turned heel and became an antagonist to feud with Hulk Hogan. Around this time he had never been pinned or put to submission in the ring. The feud culminated at WrestleMania III, and Andre was slated to lose because of his deteriorating health. The feud continued with the “Million Dollar Man” Ted DiBiase getting involved, and as Ted’s henchman, Andre finally defeated Hogan. He sold the title to DiBiase, but that was declared invalid and the title was vacated. After Andre’s feud with Hogan, he then feuded with Jake “The Snake” Roberts and The Ultimate Warrior. He also became well known in late 1989 for his tag team association with Haku (Tonga Fifita); they were called the Colossal Connection and eventually became the WWF Tag Team Champions. In the 1990s, Andre’s appearances became fewer, and he wrestled a few times only before moving to All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he wrestled, and at Universal Wrestling Association before finally retiring.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Andre had a daughter who was born on 1979. A year after his retirement he would pass away in his sleep in Paris at the age of 46; according to reports, he died of congestive heart failure. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered on his family ranch.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>André the Giant</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 19, 1946 Grenoble, France</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>January 27, 1993, Paris, France</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Grenoble, Isère, France</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>7′ (2.13 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>235.9&nbsp;kg235.9&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>French professional wrestler, actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>French</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Robin Christiansen</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Boris Roussimouff, Mariann Roussimouff</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000764</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>WWF World Heavyweight Champion, WWF Tag Team Champion, WWF Hall of Fame (1993)</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>The Six Million Dollar Man (1976),”Snow White and the Seven Lady Truckers” (1981), “Heaven Is in Your Genes” (1983), “The Goonies ‘R’ Good Enough”, Conan the Destroyer (1984), Micki & Maude (1984), I Like to Hurt People (1985), I Like to Hurt People (1985), The Princess Bride (1987),Trading Mom (199…</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“WrestleMania III”, “AWA All-Star Wrestling” (1960-1990), The Greatest American Hero, B.

Andre the Giant helped her by placing one of his hands over her head; his hands were so large that one would entirely cover the top of her head, keeping her warm.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>According to author William Goldman, when he was first trying to get The Princess Bride made in the 1970s, a then-unknown Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted to play Fezzik, and he was strongly being considered because Goldman could never get his first choice, Andre the Giant to read for the role. By the time the movie was made about twelve years later, Arnold was such a big star they could not afford him, and Andre was cast after all, and the two big men had gone on to become friends.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Despite his character Fezzik’s almost-superhuman strength in The Princess Bride, Andre the Giant’s back problems at the time prevented him from actually lifting anything heavy. Robin Wright Penn had to be attached to wires in the scene where Buttercup jumps from the castle window into Fezzik’s arms because he couldn’t support her himself.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>From Bobby Heenan’s book: Andre had a bad habit of never buttoning his shirt in public places. One day, Andre and the Brain were in a small country and western bar, when Andre had refused to button his shirt. A bouncer demanded that Andre button his shirt. Andre remained silent and continued to drink. The manager called the police. The officer that arrived reminded Heenan of Barney Fife from The Andy Griffith Show. “Barney” told Andre to button his shirt. Andre still drank quietly. “Barney” called for backup. “Barney” asked that Andre button his shirt again when several officers came in to backup “Barney.” Andre stood up, and “Barney” realized that it was just too hot to be indoors.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>In the mid 1970s, while visiting Montréal, André was in a bar drinking when four drunken men came in, recognized him, and started to taunt him. After patiently trying to avoid a confrontation, André finally got fed up and chased the four men out into the parking lot. When the four men got into their car, André simply grabbed the car, turned it over onto its roof with the four men inside, and left.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>One time in the early 1980s during an early stint Bad News Brown had with WWE, the wrestlers were all on a bus traveling between shows. A very drunk Andre the Giant was in the back of the bus with Hulk Hogan and company telling racist jokes that Bad News Brown took offense to. Bad News Brown stood up, and yelled for him to shut up, then when he turned around, Andre cursed at him. Bad News Brown had the driver stop the bus, and told Andre to meet him outside. Andre refused, and Hogan, and others tried to soothe the situation. The next day Andre apologized to Bad News Brown. Bad News Brown later admitted he was glad nothing ever happened because he believed Andre could have really hurt him.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>NFL legend Ernie Holmes got hot-headed backstage at a WWE taping in 1986. Andre the Giant muttered to him, “You know, you talk too much,” and Holmes never said a peep after that. According to two people in the van when it happened (it was a rehearsal for the Battle Royal at Wrestlemania II), Holmes was talking about how tough he was, and Andre got tired of hearing about it.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>In 1965, Andre the Giant received a draft notice for French’s peace time army, but was unable to join as there were no shoes big enough, bunks long enough, or trenches deep enough to accommodate him.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Samuel Beckett, his neighbor, used to drive him to school.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Daughter is Robin Christiansen who was born in 1979. Her mother is Jean Christiansen of the Seattle, Washington area.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Mentioned in the 1974 Guinness Book of World Records as the highest paid wrestler in history, up to that time. He earned $400,000 in one year alone during the early 1970s.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Was considered for the role of Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Former NWA Tri-State Tag Team Champion.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Billy Crystal was inspired to write the script to the movie My Giant (1998) from having worked with ‘Andre The Giant’ in the The Princess Bride (1987).</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>WrestleMania V (1989): Lost by DQ to Jake Roberts (aka Jake “The Snake” Roberts).</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Andre continued to compete in tag team matches, primarily in Japan and Mexico, until the end of 1992.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Actually signed all his personal checks, “Andre the Giant”.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Former World Tag Team champion.</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Previous Managers: Bobby Heenan, Ted DiBiase, Frank Valois, Lou Albano, KY Wakamatsu, Tim White.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2002 (charter class).</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>As a child, his next-door neighbor was Samuel Beckett.</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Because of his size, he had a custom built recliner in his home that he always sat in when he was not on the road.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>He weighed 530 pounds at the time of his death.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Andre was defeated by Jerry Lawler (aka “The King”) in a match circa 1975. Lawler had caused Andre to be knocked from the ring, and Andre was unable to answer the ten-count, thus giving rise to the infamous story “The Night Andre the Giant lost to a midget!”.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Godfather of Bill Eadie’s daughter.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>It wasn’t until he was an adult, on a wrestling tour of Japan, that he went to see doctors to determine the cause of his condition. The Japanese doctors diagnosed the cause as acromegaly, a rare condition in which victims are not expected to live beyond the age of 40. Andre lived to be 46.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>He would not commonly address people by their names, instead, if he liked someone he would call them “Boss”.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Washington Redskins head coach George Allen once offered Andre a contract to play professional football.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>Notable title wins include: IWA Tag Titles with Michael Nader; Austral-Asian Tag Titles with Ron Miller; NWA U.S. (Tri-State) Tag Titles with Dusty Rhodes; Florida Tag Titles with Rhodes; WWF Heavyweight Title; WWF Tag Team Titles (with Tonga Fifita, aka Haku).</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Was a close friend of Bobby Heenan (aka “The Brain”).</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Was an expert card player and collector of fine wines.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>Sole survivor of the 1987 WWF Survivor Series main event, which pitted himself, King Kong Bundy, “Ravishing” Rick Rude, George Gray (aka One Man Gang) and “The Natural” Butch Reed against the team of Hulk Hogan, Ken Patera, “Mr. Wonderful” Paul Orndorff, “The Rock” Don Muraco and ‘Scott ‘Bam Bam’ Bigelow’ in an elimination match. He pinned Bigelow to win the match.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Had a very close friendship with WWE referee Tim White.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>Contrary to popular belief, Killer Khan didn’t break Andre’s leg. Andre actually got out of bed one day, and his leg snapped due to his life-threatening illness. He was out for weeks, and the story was that Killer Khan did it, to hype up their feud.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>Appeared in WrestleMania VII (1991) in the corner of The Big Bossman when he took on Curt Hennig (aka Mr. Perfect) for the Intercontinental championship.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>One of Andre’s most memorable feuds was in 1981 vs. Killer Khan. The feud exploded after a May 2 match, wherein Khan (who had cheated throughout the match) broke Andre’s knee by leaping on it. Nearly four months later, Andre returned and demanded a rematch vs. Khan … and got it. He beat Khan so badly the Mongolian superstar had to be carried from the ring on a stretcher. Andre also won a series of “stretcher” matches against Khan in the fall of 1981.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>Made his last WWF appearance in 1991 at Summerslam (1991), as a second to The Bushwhackers in their match against the ‘Natural Disasters’.</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>Andre’s most bitter feud began in 1983, against Big John Studd (who claimed he, not Andre, was the true “giant” of wrestling). The feud included a series of bodyslam matches (including one at WrestleMania (1985), where Studd had to pay $10,000 (later, $15,000) to anyone who could bodyslam him.</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>Andre’s 1988 match vs. Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Championship, which he won in controversial fashion, was the 1988 Pro Wrestling Illustrated “Match of the Year.” The match, which took place in Indianapolis, was part of the first professional wrestling program to air in prime-time since the mid-’50s.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>After pinning Hulk Hogan (even though “the Hulkster” clearly had his left shoulder raised) and being awarded the WWF World Championship belt, Andre “surrendered” it immediately to Ted DiBiase (who, in a storyline, was said to have paid Andre to give him the belt, should he win it); DiBiase previously had tried, without success, to either win or purchase Hogan’s title.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>A fan favorite for most of his career, Andre turned “heel” in 1987 in time for his WrestleMania III (1987) match vs. Hulk Hogan. He turned good again after WrestleMania VI (1990), after Bobby Heenan blamed the Giant for losing the WWF Tag Team belts he and Tonga Fifita (a.k.a. Haku) held to Bill Eadie and Barry Darsow (a.k.a. Demolition).</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>One of the 100 Greatest Wrestlers of the 20th Century (Inside Wrestling Presents, Summer 2000).</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>Awarded the 1993 PWI Editor’s Award.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Ranked #3 in the “PWI 500” of the PWI Years (1979-1999) (Pro Wrestling Illustrated 20th Anniversary Special)</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>Conceptual artist Shepard Fairey uses Andre’s image in a series of posters and stickers as part of his “Phenomenology” project.</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>Lost a few inches of height because of a back surgery in the mid-1980s, but still stood about 6′ 10″ even after his posture was affected.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>At time of death, was in Paris to attend his father’s funeral.</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>Weighed about 520 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>Professional wrestler</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>André suffered from acromegaly, in which the body doesn’t stop secreting growth hormone.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>WrestleMania VI (1990): Lost tag team titles with Tonga Fifita (a.k.a.
