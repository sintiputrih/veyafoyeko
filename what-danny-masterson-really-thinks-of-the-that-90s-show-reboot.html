At the time, it was announced that Netflix had reached a deal for the reboot, and Kurtwood Smith along with Debra Jo Rupp were confirmed for the series.</p><p>Not only was Masterson excited for the show, but he praised the involvement of his two former co-stars.</p><p>He said in the Instagram post, "This is literally the dopest thing Iâ€™ve heard in a decade.

Given his current court trial, matched with a troubled relationship with Netflix (he got fired from The Ranch), not getting to be on the reboot shouldn't be too surprising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, according to Fox News, his days in court don't seem to be over with, as <a href=#>he's expected to start a new trial over again.</a></p><p>The statement reads, "The District Attorneyâ€™s Office will retry Mr. Masterson on the same counts," the DA said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital on Tuesday. "The next court date is Feb. 16 for a status conference. "Motion hearings are scheduled for March 6 and March 27. Jury selection in the retrial is set to begin March 29."</p><p>Masterson won't be working on any new projects either, as the actor hasn't worked on anything since getting the boot from his series alongside Ashton Kutcher in, The Ranch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGius2yZKaZo6mys7%2FOp2SrnZGhubp506Ggp6OjYrynedOhnGasmJbBboWPrGSsoJ%2BserOxwaimrWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-danny-masterson-really-thinks-of-the-that-90s-show-reboot.html&text=What%20Danny%20Masterson%20Really%20Thinks%20Of%20The%20That%20%2790s%20Show%20Reboot&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-danny-masterson-really-thinks-of-the-that-90s-show-reboot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-danny-masterson-really-thinks-of-the-that-90s-show-reboot.html&title=What%20Danny%20Masterson%20Really%20Thinks%20Of%20The%20That%20%2790s%20Show%20Reboot" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-danny-masterson-really-thinks-of-the-that-90s-show-reboot.html&title=What%20Danny%20Masterson%20Really%20Thinks%20Of%20The%20That%20%2790s%20Show%20Reboot" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-danny-masterson-really-thinks-of-the-that-90s-show-reboot.html&title=What%20Danny%20Masterson%20Really%20Thinks%20Of%20The%20That%20%2790s%20Show%20Reboot" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-danny-masterson-really-thinks-of-the-that-90s-show-reboot.html&description=What%20Danny%20Masterson%20Really%20Thinks%20Of%20The%20That%20%2790s%20Show%20Reboot" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./disney-gives-johnny-depp-anoth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Disney Gives Johnny Depp Another Free Trip to the Caribbean">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-can-i-say-instead-of-thirdly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What can I say instead of Thirdly?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
