In just a few years, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a></strong> will be celebrating its 50th anniversary, currently encompassing 12 movies and many live-action and animated television shows.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Over that time the franchise has amassed a glittering array of stars who’ve walked the Tatooine sands, swung a lightsaber, or piloted an X-Wing. Sadly, the steady passage of time means many of them are no longer with us. So, here are the prominent Star Wars actors who have died.</p><h2 id=h-carrie-fisher-leia-organa data-injectable=false>Carrie Fisher (Leia Organa)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/princess-leia-star-wars-a-new-hope-e1683197336248.jpg><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Carrie Fisher surely needs no introduction to Star Wars fans. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Leia became an instant cultural icon</a> when A New Hope hit screens in 1977 and went on to become a pivotal character in the Original Trilogy. Fisher reprised the role three decades later for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, with Lucasfilm assembling a posthumous performance in The Rise of Skywalker from unused footage.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>Outside of Star Wars, Fisher was a critically acclaimed author and script doctor. Her books Postcards from the Edge, Wishful Drinking, and The Princess Diarist are excellent reads and she was an uncredited script doctor on many major Hollywood movies, including Sister Act, The Wedding Singer, and Hook. She even worked on The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones screenplays to punch up the dialogue.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Beyond Star Wars, Fisher gave memorable performances in The Blues Brothers, When Harry Met Sally, Hannah and her Sisters and picked up two Emmy nominations for her guest roles on 30 Rock and Catastrophe.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>On Dec. 23, 2016, Fisher suffered a medical emergency while on board a flight from London to Los Angeles. On landing, she was rushed to intensive care, though never regained consciousness and died on Dec. 27, 2016.</p><h2 id=h-alec-guinness-obi-wan-kenobi data-injectable=false>Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image_2022-10-14_145834679-e1697022897781.png><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>Alec Guinness was famously dismissive of Star Wars and was unhappy in his later years that, after a long career, all people wanted to talk about was Obi-Wan Kenobi. He said, “Apart from the money, I regret having embarked on the film,” dismissed George Lucas’ dialogue as “lamentable,” and even claimed, “It’s not an acting job.”</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Guinness had a point. Long before he ever ignited a lightsaber he was renowned for his performances in Ealing comedies Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Lavender Hill Mob, and The Ladykillers. In 1957 he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for The Bridge on the River Kwai and picked up a writing nomination in 1958 for adapting the novel The Horse’s Mouth.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>Presumably to his surprise, he also acquired an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor for A New Hope, Regardless of whether he liked it or not, Obi-Wan remains the role he’s most strongly identified with (that whirring sound you hear is him spinning furiously in his grave). Guinness died at age 86 in August 2000 after being diagnosed with prostate and liver cancer.</p><h2 id=h-christopher-lee-count-dooku data-injectable=false>Christopher Lee (Count Dooku)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Untitled-design-5-1.png><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Christopher Lee was a screen icon long before Star Wars debuted, making a name for himself as Count Dracula in numerous Hammer Horror movies. It was likely with these in mind that Lucas chose Lee as Attack of the Clones‘ villain Count Dooku. Predictably, Lee delivered the goods, going so far as to perform the lightsaber battles himself (though a stunt double was used for some longer shots.)</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Dooku was a big part of Lee’s late-career renaissance, as the movies released concurrently with his performance as Saruman in Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lee would reprise the role of Dooku in Revenge of the Sith and provide his voice for the 2008 The Clone Wars movie.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Lee died at age 93 in June 2015 after being admitted to hospital for respiratory problems and heart failure.</p><h2 id=h-peter-cushing-grand-moff-tarkin data-injectable=false>Peter Cushing (Grand Moff Tarkin)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Darth_Sidious_apprentices_Tarkin-e1655224606303.jpg><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Like Christopher Lee (whom he was close friends with) Peter Cushing had a memorable career in Hammer Horror long before Star Wars, notably playing Baron Frankenstein and Van Helsing in multiple movies. Cushing was George Lucas’ first choice for Grand Moff Tarkin, believing that A New Hope needed a lead villain whose face was visible (as opposed to the masked Darth Vader).</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Cushing adored A New Hope, with his only regret that Tarkin being killed in the Death Star explosion meant he couldn’t return for the sequels. Cushing died in August 1994 at the age of 81, though Tarkin was (controversially) digitally resurrected for 2016’s Rogue One.</p><h2 id=h-peter-mayhew-chewbacca data-injectable=false>Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-596958848.jpg><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>We may have never seen Peter Mayhew’s face in any Star Wars movie, but we certainly felt his presence. Mayhew was 7’3 tall, making him the ideal actor to play Chewbacca, something George Lucas instantly recognized when he met him. Aside from playing Chewie on film, Mayhew regularly appeared as the character in hospital appearances for sick children and was a constant presence at fan events.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Mayhew reprised the role for The Force Awakens, though retired from the role for health reasons and was replaced by Joonas Suotama (Mayhew was the “Chewbacca consultant” for The Last Jedi). Mayhew died of a heart attack in April 2019 at age 74.</p><h2 id=h-david-prowse-darth-vader data-injectable=false>David Prowse (Darth Vader)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-607402220.jpg><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>David Prowse was the man under Darth Vader’s armor throughout the original trilogy, with his imposing stature and movement key to bringing the villain to life. Prowse was famously under the impression that he’d also be voicing Vader during A New Hope, though his strong West Country accent led him to be dubbed “Darth Farmer” by the cast.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>Prowse was key to bringing Vader to life in the original trilogy, though in later years had a long-running feud with Lucasfilm over residual payments. He died in November 2020 aged 85 of an unspecified illness, with George Lucas releasing a statement that he was “essential for the character.”</p><h2 id=h-kenny-baker-r2-d2 data-injectable=false>Kenny Baker (R2-D2)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-121443360.jpg><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>Kenny Baker began his showbiz career in 1951 when he was approached on the street by a woman inviting him to join a “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">theatrical troupe of dwarfs and midgets</a>.” He went on to specialize in ice skating and ice shows, as well as leading the successful comedy act the Mini-Tones.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>But it was with Star Wars that he made his name as everyone’s favorite beeping trashcan R2-D2. Baker played the role in both the original and prequel trilogies, as well as playing the Ewok that steals the speeder biker in Return of the Jedi. Baker was set to reprise the role once more for The Force Awakens, but his physical health meant he ended up as a consultant.</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Baker died in August 2016 after suffering a long lung illness.</p><h2 id=h-jeremy-bulloch-boba-fett data-injectable=false>Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-451225140.jpg><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Boba Fett may have minimal screen time in the original trilogy, but it’s easy to see why Star Wars fans latched onto this competent and ruthless masked bounty hunter. Jeremy Bulloch was the man inside the Boba Fett costume during the original trilogy, though the voice was provided by Jason Wingreen (who was himself overdubbed with Temuera Morrison in later releases).</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Bulloch also appeared in two other minor roles: as the Imperial officer who grabs Leia when she tells Luke that Vader is setting a trap in The Empire Strikes Back and in Revenge of the Sith as Captain Colton, the Alderaanian pilot who flies Obi-Wan, Bail Organa, and Yoda to Coruscant.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Bulloch battled Parkinson’s disease for several years and died in hospital in December 2020, aged 75.</p><h2 id=h-sebastian-shaw-anakin-skywalker data-injectable=false>Sebastian Shaw (Anakin Skywalker)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sebastian-Shaw-as-the-unmasked-Darth-Vader-in-Return-of-the-Jedi.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Sebastian Shaw’s time in Star Wars can be measured in seconds, though every one of them counts. Shaw plays the dying Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes of Return of the Jedi, finally revealing the sad and injured old man under the imposing armor. Prior to this, Shaw had a long career on stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company and Lucas cast him on the basis of that experience.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Shaw also appeared as a Force Ghost in the final scene of the movie, though his performance was controversially erased in the 2004 release and replaced with Hayden Christensen.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>Post-release, Shaw was surprised and delighted by the attention his brief performance received and was inundated with fan mail and autograph requests. Shaw died of natural causes in Dec. 1994 at the age of 89.</p><h2 id=h-ray-stevenson-gar-saxon-baylan-skoll data-injectable=false>Ray Stevenson (Gar Saxon / Baylan Skoll)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chrome_2023-10-04_10-01-05.jpg><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Ray Stevenson’s Baylan Skoll was arguably <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the single best thing about Disney Plus’ Ahsoka</a>. Baylan is a mysterious fallen Jedi turned mercenary, though, over the first season, we gradually learned he had greater aspirations to end the cycle of war and peace at the heart of Star Wars. Sadly we will never get to see Stevenson complete Baylan’s story, as he died of unknown causes in May 2023.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>But Ahsoka wasn’t Stevenson’s first Star Wars role. In Rebels and The Clone Wars, he voiced Gar Saxon, a Mandalorian super commando who became the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore during the reign of the Galactic Empire.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Aside from Star Wars, Stevenson was known for playing Frank Castle in The Punisher: War Zone, as the Asgardian Volstagg in the MCU’s Thor movies, and as Titus Pullo in Rome.</p><h2 id=h-carl-weathers-greef-karga data-injectable=false>Carl Weathers (Greef Karga)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Carl-Weathers-Greef-Karga.png><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>“MANDO!” Carl Weathers’ The Mandalorian hero Greef Karga was one of the most charismatic and energetic characters in the show, with an arc taking him from the leader of the Bounty Hunters’ Guild to the High Magistrate of Nevarro. Throughout he was a staunch ally to Din Djarin and Grogu, participating in most of their major battles.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Weathers adored the role, describing it as “one of the greatest things that’s happened in all of the years that I’ve been in entertainment”, and was rightly nominated for an Emmy. He went on to direct two episodes of the show, both of which can be ranked amongst its best.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>And, of course, Weathers was already a full-on icon for his roles in the Rocky franchise, Predator, Toy Story and Arrested Development (amongst many more). Beyond all that, he was also an NFL linebacker, playing for the Oakland Raiders in the early 1970s. What a life.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>Weathers died on Feb. 1 2024 at the age of 76 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</a>.</p><h2 id=h-other-notable-deaths data-injectable=false>Other notable deaths</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1Yy0R.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>We have to also tip our hat to some other Star Wars luminaries. Several Ewok actors in Return of the Jedi have died: Paul Grant at age 56 in March 2023, Gary Friedkin at age 70 in Dec. 2022, Jack Purvis at age 60 in Nov. 1997, and Felix Silla at age 84 in April 2021.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>Two X-Wing pilots have also left us: Red Leader actor Drewe Henley died at age 75 in Feb. 2016 and Porkins’ actor William Hootkins died at age 57 in 2005. Phil Brown played Owen Lars in A New Hope and died aged 89 in Feb. 2006, with Beru Lars actor Shelagh Fraser dying aged 79 in Aug. 2000.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>The original voice of Boba Fett, Jason Wingreen, died at age 95 on Dec. 25 2015. Alex McCrindle, who played General Dodonna in A New Hope died at age 78 in April 1990. John Hollis played Lobot in The Empire Strikes Back and died aged 77 in 2005.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Eddie Byrne made his final film appearance before his death as General Willard in A New Hope and died aged 70 in Aug. 1981. Larry Ward voiced Greedo in A New Hope and Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi and died at age 63 in 2007. Finally, Declan Mulholland, whose performance as a human version of Jabba the Hutt was cut from A New Hope entirely, died in June 1999 at the age of 66.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGhk516tMDAq2SwmaKoeqKv06iprGWYlsOmecOinJ1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhich-star-wars-actors-have-died.html&text=Which%20Star%20Wars%20actors%20have%20died%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhich-star-wars-actors-have-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-star-wars-actors-have-died.html&title=Which%20Star%20Wars%20actors%20have%20died%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhich-star-wars-actors-have-died.html&title=Which%20Star%20Wars%20actors%20have%20died%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-star-wars-actors-have-died.html&title=Which%20Star%20Wars%20actors%20have%20died%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhich-star-wars-actors-have-died.html&description=Which%20Star%20Wars%20actors%20have%20died%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-has-joe-jonas-dated-joe-jonas-dating-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who has Joe Jonas dated?
