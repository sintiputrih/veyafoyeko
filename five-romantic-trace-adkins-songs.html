Known for his signature baritone voice, Adkins has gone on to release several successful albums including his 2005 project, Songs About Me. &nbsp;The album has been certified 2x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and spawned some of Adkins’ most popular songs including “Honky Tonky Badonkadonk.” His career as a country musician has earned him several awards including the 2009 ACM Single of the Year. Aside from singing, Adkins has also made several television and film appearances. In 2004, he earned a recurring voice role on the popular cartoon sitcom, King of the Hill, and in 2013 he became the winning contestant on Donal Trump’s Celebrity Apprentice. However, even with all of his honors and accolades, Louisiana born Adkins is a small-town country boy who enjoys&nbsp;expressing himself through song. And because no country musician’s career is complete without an extensive catalog of love themed music; here are the five most romantic Trace Adkins songs.</p><h2>5. “Love Will…”</h2><p>Trace Adkins’ 2013 song, “Love Will…” was released on his album of the same name. &nbsp;The song, which features the Harlem Gospel Choir, sweetly details how love can truly conquer all. &nbsp;As Adkins sings, “There’ll be times that we disagree/About the way things are supposed to be/And when we can’t find the common ground/When we can’t work it out…love will…” it is clear that he is willing to stick around for the long haul. &nbsp;The song’s open-ended title also allows listeners to come up with their own interpretations of what love will do for them. &nbsp;Although the song was not released as a single, it has been a favorite among Adkins fans who enjoy hearing him sing about life’s heartwarming moments.</p><h2>4. “I Can Only Love You Like A Man”</h2><p>While many people try to convince themselves, and their lover(s), that they are capable of providing superhuman love, Trace Adkins takes a more honest approach with his song “I Can Only Love You Like A Man. &nbsp;As the title suggests, Adkins makes it clear that he is just a man who is doing the best that he can to give the woman he loves everything she deserves. &nbsp;As he sings: “There ain’t no knights in shinin` armor/There ain’t no never, never land/And I won’t ever walk on water/I can only love you like a man,” he quickly dispels the notion that fairy tale endings exist. &nbsp;However, even in a world full of imperfections, Adkins can still promise to love.</p><h2>3. “Baby I’m Home”</h2><p>Released on his 2x platinum album, 2005’s, Songs About Me, Trace Adkins’ “Baby I’m Home” is all about returning home. As a musician, Adkins is demanding schedule has probably made him all too familiar with the feeling of having to leave his loved ones behind. &nbsp;The song’s chorus: “Baby, I’m home/I’ve been away way too long/I’ve been waitin’, I’ve been working’/Wantin’ you so bad it’s hurting’/Now I’m back where I belong/Baby I’m home,” describes the anguish Adkins felt while being away from his lover. &nbsp;Although the song isn’t overly emotional, it still allows for listeners to connect with Adkins during his moment of homecoming.</p><h2>2. “The Altar of Your Love”</h2><p>Although the title suggests that the song may be about a higher power, Trace Adkins’ “The Altar of Your Love” is actually about a love so strong that it provides him with a place of refuge. &nbsp; Music blogger, Daryl Addison, described the song as “a hard country, electric rocker barely held back by palm-muted power chords.” Written by Adkins, “The Altar of Your Love” expresses his vulnerable side as he sings: “Everybody needs somebody to trust/With the broken pieces/Somebody who believes in you enough/To help you fight your demons/Another day has done me in/So wrap me up in your arms again/Baby bring me back to life/Heaven knows I need you tonight to…” &nbsp;Although Adkins’ booming voice could easily fool listeners into thinking that he is too tough to express his feelings, time-and-time again he proves that there is no shame in loving.</p><h2>1. “When I Stop Loving You”</h2><p>The title may suggest that Adkins is contemplating ending a relationship; however, the lyrics eventually&nbsp;let listeners know that is planning on doing the exact opposite. &nbsp;As he sweetly sings: “here’ll be no peaches down in Georgia, no oil in Oklahoma/No sun in Arizona, no stars in California/No cowboys out in Texas, no wheat fields in Kansas/No Colorado skies of blue/When I stop loving you,” Adkins makes it clear that the world will end before he stops loving his girl. &nbsp;Although the song is not one of Adkins’ most popular tracks, many of his fans have expressed a deep liking for the song. &nbsp;One listener even commented that she appreciated Adkins’ ability to wear his heart on his sleeve.</p><p>(Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYr%2BwucCnq6KbXam%2Foq%2FEZpido5mjwG6%2FzqeerGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffive-romantic-trace-adkins-songs.html&text=The%20Five%20Most%20Romantic%20Trace%20Adkins%20Songs&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffive-romantic-trace-adkins-songs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffive-romantic-trace-adkins-songs.html&title=The%20Five%20Most%20Romantic%20Trace%20Adkins%20Songs" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffive-romantic-trace-adkins-songs.html&title=The%20Five%20Most%20Romantic%20Trace%20Adkins%20Songs" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffive-romantic-trace-adkins-songs.html&title=The%20Five%20Most%20Romantic%20Trace%20Adkins%20Songs" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffive-romantic-trace-adkins-songs.html&description=The%20Five%20Most%20Romantic%20Trace%20Adkins%20Songs" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiny-twins-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiny Twins Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jintara-poonlarp-net-worth-331494.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jintara Poonlarp Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
