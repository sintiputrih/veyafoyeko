To this day, Swift struggles to see photos of herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She explains, “It’s not good for me to see pictures of myself every day. It’s only happened a few times, and I’m not in any way proud of it." She continues, "A picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or… someone said that I looked pregnant … and that’ll just trigger me to just starve a little bit — just stop eating.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bono-wanted-to-keep-it-quiet-but-taylor-swift-revealed-the-special-gift-she-got-from-the-u2-star-front-commons-licenses-back-the-graham-norton-show-the-graham-norton-show-_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bono Wanted To Keep It Quiet But Taylor Swift Revealed The Special Gift She Got From The U2 Star</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bono had a shy reaction to Taylor Swift's gift reveal on The Graham Norton Show.</span><p>Swift would go on to recall a specific photo taken when she was only 18, that linked her to a possible pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine,” she says. “And the headline was like ‘Pregnant at 18?’ And it was because I had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat. So I just registered that as a punishment."</p><p>Swift continues, "And then I’d walk into a photo shoot and be in the dressing room and somebody who worked at a magazine would say, ‘Oh, wow, this is so amazing that you can fit into the sample sizes. Usually we have to make alterations to the dresses, but we can take them right off the runway and put them on you!’ And I looked at that as a pat on the head. You register that enough times, and you just start to accommodate everything towards praise and punishment, including your own body.”</p><p>A tough reality for Swift, and it was something that was even harder to speak out about.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-admitted-it-was-hard-to-speak-out-about-her-disorder>Taylor Swift Admitted It Was Hard To Speak Out About Her Disorder</h2><p>Not only was dealing with the disorder difficult, but during her interview with Variety, the artist also mentioned that speaking out about it wasn't easy either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She revealed, “I think I’ve never really wanted to talk about that before, and I’m pretty uncomfortable talking about it now,” she says quietly. “But in the context of every other thing that I was doing or not doing in my life, I think it makes sense," Swift reveals finally opening up about her past struggles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-02t145656-775.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-04t101009-305.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Handled The Boos At Her Friend's Wedding In The Best Way Possible</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift was booed by her own fans at her friend's wedding, but handled it all the right way.</span><p>Swift would go on to reveal that she wasn't sure if discussing food was the right way to go, given the struggle with it over the years.
