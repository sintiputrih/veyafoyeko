Above 160 IQ.<h2>Can you be gifted and have a low IQ?</h2>But the bar is high to be classified as gifted: Students who aren't from disadvantaged backgrounds have to have an IQ of at least 130; students who are learning English or who are from poor families can meet a slightly lower bar, an IQ of higher than 116. And so gifted kids are rare.<h2>Is an IQ of 130 considered gifted?</h2>115 to 129: Above average or bright. 130 to 144: Moderately gifted. 145 to 159: Highly gifted. 160 to 179: Exceptionally gifted.<h2>What is the average IQ of a 15 year old?</h2>As per research, the average IQ for each age group may be interpreted in the following manner: The average score for 16-17 year-olds is 108, which denotes normal or average intelligence.

Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist and philosopher of science whose estimated IQ scores range from 205 to 225 by different measures.

IQ tests are age adjusted, basically to take account of youth and inexperience (under 18) or age and diminishing speed. The reason is that, as we get older, diminishing speed and spatial awareness are balanced by having more knowledge and experience to draw on to solve problems.<h2>What is a high IQ for a 30 year old?</h2>But scores between 90 and 109 indicate a “normal or average intelligence” or “higher average.” While scores between 110 and 119 are indicative of a “superior intelligence” or “above average.” Anyone scoring between 120 and 140 in their IQ test would be classified as having a “superior intelligence” or being “gifted.” ...<h2>How do I know if I am intelligent?</h2>"A highly intelligent person is one who is flexible in their thinking and can adapt to changes, they think before they speak or act, and they're able to effectively manage their emotions," Dr. Catherine Jackson, licensed clinical psychologist and board certified neurotherapist, tells Bustle.<h2>What do geniuses do for fun?</h2>Do you enjoy playing logic, word and trivia games to train and test your brain?
