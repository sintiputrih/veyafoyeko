The movie had four sequels, and Beverly reprised her role in all of them.</p><p>“A Streetcar Named Desire” gained D’Angelo an Emmy nomination in 1984. The TV film is about a woman named Blanche Dubois, a crazy, anxious lady who is desperately searching for somewhere she belongs, because she was shunned from her hometown, for having an affair with a seventeen year-old boy student at the school where she was an English teacher.</p><p>In 1992 Beverly added voice actress to her resume when she made a guest ‘appearance’ in season three of “The Simpsons” as Lurleen Lumpkin in the episode entitled “Colonel Homer” playing a waitress and country western singer.
