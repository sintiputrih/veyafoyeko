Smith storms the stage and slaps Chris Rock...</p><p>In truth, <a href=#>it wasn't the first time Smith lost his cool</a>. <a href=#>Given his history alongside wife Jada</a>, Smith did not take kindly to the joke - especially given her condition linked to hair loss. However, there was a bit of a history between the two, and we'll revisit a particular moment that might've ignited things back in 2016.</p><h2 id=do-chris-rock-and-will-smith-have-history>Do Chris Rock And Will Smith Have History?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a night that should've celebrated Will Smith's talents as an actor. However, things quickly turned when the Oscar-winner got up off his seat to address a joke made by Chris Rock, pertaining to his wife's hair.</p><p>In truth, this isn't the first time Will Smith loses his cool out in public. A similar situation took place on the red carpet out in Russia during the premiere of 'Men In Black'.</p><p>Will Smith actually slapped an interviewer for getting a little too close during their embrace.</p><p>After the exchange took place, you can hear Will say, "he's lucky I didn't sucker punch him in the face."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Rihanna Really Reject Chris Rock?</a></span></p><p>The moment has nearly 12 million views - though the biggest difference is this time around, fans were praising Smith for reacting the way he did.</p><p>"People saying "Will over reacted" or "is that all" how would you react if a guy tried to kiss a female person on the red carpet? everyone would call him a pervert and a creep then. What Will did was totally right."</p><p>"Love that he was able to slap a man on camera and still somehow come off as polite and charming about it. haha."</p><p>It was a different story on Oscar night, as things got extremely quiet when Smith unleashed on Chris Rock.</p><h2 id=it-wasn-39-t-the-first-time-chris-rock-joked-about-jada-pinkett-smith>It Wasn't The First Time Chris Rock Joked About Jada Pinkett-Smith</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kudos to Chris Rock, who somehow was able to keep his composure throughout the moment. He's one of the few in all of Hollywood who would be able to keep it together after such a moment.</p><p>In truth, this is far from the only time Rock made a joke about Smith's wife. In truth, the two go back, especially for a certain moment in 2016 when Jada was none too pleased about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. She stated that she would be boycotting the show because of it.</p><p>That year, Chris Rock was hosting the Oscars <a href=#>and he would make a joke about it</a>, saying "Isn't she on a TV show? Jada got mad, said she's not coming. Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited."</p><p>"'You get mad. It's not fair that Will was this good and didn't get nominated.

This is about children that are going to sit down and watch this show and they're not going to see themselves represented. There's a regressive slide toward separatism, towards racial and religious disharmony. And that's not the Hollywood that I want to leave behind."</p><p>Jada and Chris are also familiar with one another on a professional level, with the two having worked on Madagascar together.</p><p>Perhaps it was a culmination of events, or perhaps at the moment, Will Smith reacted on emotion, especially given how seriously his wife has addressed the matter of her hair loss.</p><p>Nonetheless, it seems like social media had a lot to say about the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-fans-think-about-the-awkward-oscar-moment-between-will-smith-and-chris-rock>What Did Fans Think About The Awkward Oscar Moment Between Will Smith And Chris Rock?</h2><p>It was an emotional night for Will Smith taking home an Oscar in such a dramatic role. However, Smith might've been too emotional and perhaps still in character when he slapped Chris Rock on the Oscar-stage.</p><p>Lots of fans commented on the matter, and it seems like the Twitter crowd had mixed reactions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of his speech, Will Smith did not apologize for the act, though he did make mention that he hopes the Academy invites him back.
