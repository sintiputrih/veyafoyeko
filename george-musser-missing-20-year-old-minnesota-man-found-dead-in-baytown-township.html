George Musser's <a href=# rel>body was found</a> at around 7.00 pm near the 5400 block of Osgood Avenue in Baytown Township, Stillwater Police Department reported.</p><p>The Stillwater Police Department has launched an investigation into <a href=# rel>the mysterious death</a> but has found no <a href=# rel>indication of foul play</a>. The area was not on George’s way back home from the restaurant where he was last seen, according to Stillwater Police Department chief Brian Mueller. "I am heartbroken to share that the police have found his body. We are trusting the lord during this horrific time that he has guided George into Heaven. Please pray for our family," George's cousin Emily Dalbec said in a Facebook group.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Nicole Barnes: 'Healthy' mother, 29, found dead at home lying next to her 3-year-old daughter</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Nesly Monterroso: Missing rapper, 27, found dead inside barrel hidden in abandoned car trunk</a></p><p>Musser, who was a student at the University of Wisconsin–River Falls, was reported missing on December 24. He was reportedly last seen at Brian’s Bar in downtown Stillwater at roughly 2.10 am, according to a statement from the department. Musser’s purse was found in a snow bank near Brian’s bar but without his ID. His car was located in the parking lot at the Freight House while his car keys were found near a trash can.</p><p>Ally McKay was one of the last people to see him. "At approximately 1.30 am, he came up to the booth I was sitting in with my friends and he was talking to us," Mckay told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CBS</a>. "He told us he had to go to the bathroom and then he never returned. We looked for him at the bar's closing, but Brian's was persistent that everyone gets out, so we left and we had to assume that he had found his way home." He was wearing a stocking cap, dark blue jeans, and a dark grey flannel shirt, his mother Nancy Musser earlier said.</p><p>Family and friends searched on Saturday and that continued, in greater numbers, on Christmas Day. "We're preparing for the worst but hoping for the best -- and that's why we're getting everyone in the community to start looking," said Emily. More than 100 people joined hands on Christmas eve to find the missing student. "Over 100 people from the community, family members, and friends," Emily Dalbec noted. Meanwhile, the family has launched a GoFundMe to pay for funeral costs. “We know George has entered heaven and God and all of his family in heaven will take care of him until we can see him again,” the page reads.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRon5Wkv6ixjKasrKuVp3qutdKsoKefXWd9bsXEmqlmp5yZeq61zaecrKeklnqurc1mnaitnpl6pbHAnWSipl2XrrrAzrClZqyfrLu0tMip</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-musser-missing-20-year-old-minnesota-man-found-dead-in-baytown-township.html&text=George%20Musser%3a%20Student%2c%2020%2c%20found%20dead%20day%20after%20mysteriously%20disappearing%20from%20Minnesota%20restaurant&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-musser-missing-20-year-old-minnesota-man-found-dead-in-baytown-township.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-musser-missing-20-year-old-minnesota-man-found-dead-in-baytown-township.html&title=George%20Musser%3a%20Student%2c%2020%2c%20found%20dead%20day%20after%20mysteriously%20disappearing%20from%20Minnesota%20restaurant" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorge-musser-missing-20-year-old-minnesota-man-found-dead-in-baytown-township.html&title=George%20Musser%3a%20Student%2c%2020%2c%20found%20dead%20day%20after%20mysteriously%20disappearing%20from%20Minnesota%20restaurant" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-musser-missing-20-year-old-minnesota-man-found-dead-in-baytown-township.html&title=George%20Musser%3a%20Student%2c%2020%2c%20found%20dead%20day%20after%20mysteriously%20disappearing%20from%20Minnesota%20restaurant" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-musser-missing-20-year-old-minnesota-man-found-dead-in-baytown-township.html&description=George%20Musser%3a%20Student%2c%2020%2c%20found%20dead%20day%20after%20mysteriously%20disappearing%20from%20Minnesota%20restaurant" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hayden-moss-net-worth-149968.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hayden Moss Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bob-baker-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Baker Children: Does Bob Baker Have Children?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
