That would be scandalous on its own, but then his wife, 30-year-old Barbara Weaver, was found shot to death in her bed. Each season of&nbsp;Case Closed&nbsp;takes a deep dive into a terrible crime, where “the bad guy didn’t get away with it.” For season three, author Charles Spicer and producer Kristy Westgard join forces to explore this gruesome murder in Amish country through interviews with experts, members of the misunderstood community, and Weaver’s own diary. The first two episodes of this season explored the crime scene and Barbara’s struggles, trapped in a marriage with a man who showed her no respect or love. The third is a real stunner, revealing in vivid detail the double life that put Eli swiftly on the police’s suspect list. With each episode clocking in around 20-minutes,&nbsp;Case Closed&nbsp;is simply too easy to binge. —Kristy Puchko</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwcotcu003j3h6ak76ljc9k@published data-word-count=7><strong>Dr. Death, “Top Doc” and “King Midas”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1d7/c1a/4837167db936422110cb3d664767ca63bc-dr-death.rsquare.w570.png><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwcozqc004u3h6a9dr6v5sl@published data-word-count=210>Season one of Dr. Death introduced listeners to Christopher Duntsch, a Texas neurosurgeon whose sloppy scalpel work led to 31 patients being seriously injured and two dying. (Duntsch was convicted of maiming one of his patients in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in prison.) One of the most unsettling aspects of Duntsch’s crimes, at least for me, was the murky intent: Did he actually mean to cause harm or was he really that blind to his shortcomings as a surgeon? We may never know for sure. But in season two of Dr. Death, which focuses on Michigan hematologist and oncologist Farid Fata, there seems to be little question about his motive — it’s greed, plain and simple. I’ll avoid too many spoilers here, as there are a couple of early-on revelations that left my jaw dropped, but suffice it to say, Fata’s crimes are unconscionable — and yet another stark reminder of just how truly broken our health-care system is. (As in the case of Duntsch, at least one complaint was filed to the appropriate medical boards with little consequence.) One final warning: If you have a loved one who’s been touched by cancer, I recommend you not listen to episode two in a public place. —Amy Wilkinson</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwcp6ou00693h6a5jmuftw5@published data-word-count=16><strong>Most Notorious, “A Shocking New Look at the 1932 Lindbergh Kidnapping & Murder w/ Lise Pearlman”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/780/ef5/1688795b35f5dd676ae1145a6c3c181d6a-most-notorious.rsquare.w570.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwcpdns007s3h6arktc9hef@published data-word-count=173>The tragedy of the Lindbergh baby began on March 1, 1932, when 20-month-old Charlie was snatched from his crib. His father, world-famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, became deeply involved in the police investigation and even toyed with having gangsters —including Al Capone — join the search. But it was all for naught. A trial of the century and conviction followed. Yet many questions about that terrible night were left unanswered. Each week on&nbsp;Most Notorious,&nbsp;host Erik Rivenes invites historians to unravel shocking tales of true crime. In this case, Lise Pearlman, author of&nbsp;The Lindbergh Kidnapping Suspect No. 1: The Man Who Got Away, lays out the conspiracy theory that alleges the ace pilot had a hand in his son’s death. This harrowing and compelling narrative ties together Lucky Lindy’s history of cruel pranks, eugenics support, and curious acquaintances, along with potential leads that were never followed. But beware: This story is not for the faint of heart. On top of grim subject matter, Pearlman veers into grisly details of Charlie’s remains without warning. —Kristy Puchko</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwcplqv009f3h6a3hmmgwpl@published data-word-count=10><strong>Crimes of the Centuries, “Leopold and Loeb: Jazz Age Killers”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/298/c2b/e7f43e4a3855dd5a6e58fad18bd43f955b-crimes-of-the-century.rsquare.w570.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwcpuc200b63h6apjdo6ut3@published data-word-count=169>Every week, journalist and aunt Amber Hunt (host of <a href=#>The Accused</a> podcast) tells us about a case we probably don’t remember or even know about, because it’s fallen out of current conversation. In this latest episode, it’s the case of Nathan Leopold, Richard Loeb, and the 1924 Chicago murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks. In addition to being an awful story about the murder of a child, it’s also an account of what can happen when the wrong people have access to money, education, and power. Hunt’s rendering is full of details about the lives of Leopold and Loeb, including the role of Nietzsche’s philosophy, and their belief that because of their intellectual prowess, they could commit a high-level crime and get away with it (spoiler: they did not get away with it). The episode is layered with information from folks deeply immersed in the case, including Paul Durica of the Newberry Library, who leads walking tours of Chicago’s Kenwood neighborhood, where the kidnapping and murder took place. —Chanel Dubofsky</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckgwcnxdu000q3h6ai00c323u@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Friday, October 23</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgla7f2m00aq3g6a90jzxvsz@published data-word-count=6><strong>Dead and Gone, “The Human Condition”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/726/0d2/a264bbda2cd0bc89f5184689a9ab3e7154-dead-and-gone.rsquare.w570.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgl9dxdh00143g6al0t53pd0@published data-word-count=212>Payne Lindsey (Up and Vanished) and Jake Brennan (Disgraceland) have teamed up for this new podcast about the dark heart of the peace-and-love ecosystem surrounding the Grateful Dead. Grateful Dead fans Mary Gioia, 22, and Greg Kniffin, 18, were horrifically murdered in 1986, in Berkeley, California, at a homeless encampment dubbed Rainbow Village. Ralph International Thomas was charged with their murders and died in jail in 2014, but plenty of questions remain about the circumstances of the Deadheads’ deaths. As Lindsey and Brennan dive into the case, a fellow Grateful Dead fan named Robert gets in touch with information about his former roomie Bo, a fellow tie-dyer and Deadhead who acted seriously weird before disappearing. As it turns out, Bo was named as a possible suspect by a woman who spotted him with Mary and Greg the night they died, but police focused on Thomas, a Black man and an ex-con, despite a lack of evidence. Was justice served, or did an innocent man die in prison? On top of being a solid crime drama, Dead and Gone also offers a fascinating look at the history of the Grateful Dead and how their accepting ethos inadvertently offered a safe haven to bad actors, not to mention the oceans of LSD. —Jenni Miller</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgla8f9i00d43g6al7qeoafr@published data-word-count=4><strong>Sinisterhood, “The Bunny Man”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/476/20e/5c78dc4f7005e93cf5b4a870997a81486f-sinisterhood.rsquare.w570.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgl9euj700483g6acmi02jls@published data-word-count=123>Are you seeking something spooky but you’re a bit of a scaredy-cat? Then you’ll want to hop down the rabbit hole with Dallas-based comedians Christie Wallace and Heather McKinney as they unravel the urban legend of the Bunny Man. In the 1970s, Fairfax, Virginia, victims reported a menacing man wearing a rabbit mask and wielding a hatchet. According to these reports, this curious critter was quite territorial, threatening violence and smashing windshields to scare off trespassers. From there, the legend of the Bunny Man has grown, spawning wild theories, a macabre tourist trap, and a string of slasher movies. With giggles and jibes, the ladies of Sinisterhood separate fact from fiction to uncover the true horror of this mysterious masked man. —Kristy Puchko</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgla99kh00em3g6av8g2bypy@published data-word-count=5><strong>Verified: Dust Up, Unlikely Partners</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdf/d51/98da16ce64275832050a3b640f484443f4-verified-dust-up.rsquare.w570.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgl9fauw006u3g6aw8j8a9m9@published data-word-count=157>In 2006, physician assistant Deane Berg was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She had none of the risk factors for this kind of cancer, which is largely hereditary, but as she examined the patient materials she’d been given, she realized&nbsp;that she did have one — she’d been using talcum powder, specifically <a href=#>Johnson and Johnson</a>, as a part of her daily personal hygiene product since she was 16.&nbsp;How could this common product be linked to cancer, and why was there no warning on the label? Berg delved into her own research, including searching for other women who also suspected the source of their cancer was the use of talc. At the same time, Alan Smith, a lawyer in Mississippi representing men who had contracted lung disease after spending years inhaling silica dust while chiseling the rust off ships sans protective equipment, began to wonder if something was up with talc.

Well, she’s got a show of her own in which this insightful poet turned podcaster digs into sociology, psychology, and biology to investigate topics like the satanic panic, Gamergate, and get-rich-quick schemes. This week, she tackled true crime in an ambitious episode that touches on JonBenét Ramsey’s murder, O.J. Simpson’s Broncho chase, the Manson family’s killings, the Zodiac’s codes, and the Golden State Killer. With playful pacing and ruthless self-interrogation, Weber-Smith not only explores the history of America’s true-crime obsession but also examines why so many of us are addicted to stories of mayhem, murder, and mystery. Adding panache to her fascinating lesson is a skillfully subtle score that brews atmosphere and dramatic readings that transport listeners from one horrid historical moment to another. But be warned!

His story has served as an inspiration for many silver-screen scares including Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Silence of the Lambs. And it’s no wonder given the bizarre, grotesque nature of his crimes: In addition to two confirmed murders, Gein body-snatched at least nine corpses from local graveyards and fashioned pieces into all manner of household goods, including a nipple belt and a lampshade made out human flesh. But I’m getting ahead of myself. In “Part 1,” Jedeikin details Gein’s troubled childhood and his close relationship with overbearing mother Augusta.

On Indigenous People’s Day, they looked to the murder case of Faith Hedgepeth, a 19-year-old Native-American college student, who was viciously slain on September 7, 2012, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. With a thirst for justice, the co-hosts carefully layout the bizarre details of this investigation, which boasts DNA evidence, a suspect who perfectly matches the criminal profile, and a distorted voicemail message that some contend recorded the killing. Maddeningly, Hedgepeth’s killer — or killers — still walks free. This is the kind of case where there are plenty of pieces to the puzzle, yet they don’t add up to a clear picture of what went down that horrid night.

Police initially gave the cases short shrift, due to the transient nature of folks traveling in and through Humboldt County, and none of them have been found. There’s no indication that the cases are connected, but there are some mysterious and sinister characters hovering around the area, including <a href=#>Robert Durst</a> and a long haul trucker/serial killer, who showed up at the police station to confess accompanied by a body part from one of his victims.

The focus, however, is less on the man himself and more on the women who helped bring him down (hence this season’s new subtitle). Once again, Connelly’s storytelling benefits from access to both bit and big players, illuminating a once-cold case that spans the country and may include upwards of 100 victims — all women. (The mind truly boggles at the sheer number — and, for lack of a better term, productivity — of serial killers during the 1970s.) While justice for each and every one of Little’s many victims will likely never be realized, there is a small bit of solace to be found in the knowledge that so many smart, tenacious women aided in his long-overdue capture and conviction. —Amy Wilkinson</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckg1hsunu000v3h67pee6alro@published data-word-count=9><strong>Crimes of Passion, “Chris Watts Pt. 1 & 2”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/79b/76d/5d69627186528ecf2ebf3bc709001f200e-crimes-of-passion.rvertical.w570.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckg1hsunx000w3h67inb8vgnn@published data-word-count=159>If you were left drop-jawed by Netflix’s true-crime documentary, American Murder: The Family Next Door, then you’ll want to hear this two-parter on family annihilator Chris Watts.
